Theorem 2.19 Let m be an integer that is the product of two prime numbers. The prime divisors of m are the roots of the quadratic equation

      $$x ^ {2} - (m + 1 - \varphi (m)) x + m = 0,$$
and so $\varphi(m)$ determines the prime factors of $m$.
  Proof. If m = pq , then

    $$\varphi (m) = (p - 1) (q - 1) = p q - p - q + 1 = m - p - \frac{m}{p} + 1,$$
and so

      $$p - (m + 1 - \varphi (m)) + \frac{m}{p} = 0.$$
Equivalently, p and q are the solutions of the quadratic equation

    $$x ^ {2} - (m + 1 - \varphi (m)) x + m = 0.$$
This completes the proof. $\square$
  For example, if $m = 221$ and $\varphi(m) = 192$, then the quadratic equation
        $$x ^ {2} - 3 0 x + 2 2 1 = 0$$
has solutions $x = 13$ and $x = 17$, and $221 = 13 \cdot 17$.
  This method, known as the RSA cryptosystem, is called a public key cryptosystem, since the encryption key is made available to everyone, and the encrypted message can be transmitted through public channels. Only the possessor of the prime factors of m can decrypt the message. RSA is simple, but useful, and is the basis of many commercially valuable cryptosystems.

## Exercises

  1. Consider the secret key cryptosystem constructed from the prime p = 947 and the encoding key e = 167 . Encipher the plaintext P = 2 . Find a decrypting key and decipher the ciphertext C = 3 .
  2. Consider the primes $p = 53$ and $q = 61$. Let $m = pq$. Prove that $e = 7$ is relatively prime to $\text{varphi}(m)$. Find a positive integer $d$ such that $ed \text{equiv} 1 \text{ (mod varphi}(m))$.
  3. The integer 6059 is the product of two distinct primes, and $\varphi(6059) = 5904$. Use Theorem 2.19 to compute the prime divisors of 6059.
  4. The probability that an integer chosen at random between 1 and $n$ is relatively prime to $n$ is $\varphi(n)/n$. Let $n = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes greater than $x$. Prove that the probability that a randomly chosen positive integer up to $x$ is relatively prime to $n$ is greater than $(1 - 1/x)^2$. If $x = 200$, this probability is greater than $0.99$.
