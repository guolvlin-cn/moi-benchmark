## A-1 The possible values comprise the interval $(0,A^2)$.

  To see that the values must lie in this interval, note that

      $$\left(\sum_ {j = 0} ^ {m} x _ {j}\right) ^ {2} = \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {m} x _ {j} ^ {2} + \sum_ {0 \leq j <   k \leq m} 2 x _ {j} x _ {k},$$
  so $\sum_{j=0}^{m} x_{j}^{2} \leq A^{2} - 2x_{0}x_{1}$. Letting $m \to \infty$, we have

$\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} x_{j}^{2} \leq A^{2} - 2x_{0}x_{1} < A^{2}$.
  To show that all values in $(0,A^2)$ can be obtained, we use geometric progressions with $x_1/x_0 = x_2/x_1 = \dots = d$ for variable $d$. Then $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} x_j = x_0/(1-d)$ and
      $$\sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} x _ {j} ^ {2} = \frac{x _ {0} ^ {2}}{1 - d ^ {2}} = \frac{1 - d}{1 + d} \left(\sum_ {j = 0} ^ {\infty} x _ {j}\right) ^ {2}.$$
  As $d$ increases from $0$ to $1$, $(1-d)/(1+d)$ decreases from $1$ to $0$. Thus if we take geometric progressions with $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x_j = A$, $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}x_j^2$ ranges from $0$ to $A^2$. Thus the possible values are indeed those in the interval $(0,A^2)$, as claimed.

## A-2 First solution: Let $a$ be an even integer such that $a^2 + 1$ is not prime. (For example, choose $a \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$, so that $a^2 + 1$ is divisible by 5.) Then we can write $a^2 + 1$ as a difference of squares $x^2 - b^2$, by factoring $a^2 + 1$ as $rs$ with $r \geq s > 1$, and setting $x = (r + s)/2$, $b = (r - s)/2$. Finally, put $n = x^2 - 1$, so that $n = a^2 + b^2$, $n + 1 = x^2$, $n + 2 = x^2 + 1$.

  Second solution: It is well-known that the equation $x^{2} - 2y^{2} = 1$ has infinitely many solutions (the so-called "Pell" equation). Thus setting $n = 2y^{2}$ (so that $n = y^{2} + y^{2}$ , $n + 1 = x^{2} + 0^{2}$ , $n + 2 = x^{2} + 1^{2}$ ) yields infinitely many $n$ with the desired property.

  Third solution: As in the first solution, it suffices to exhibit $x$ such that $x^2 - 1$ is the sum of two squares. We will take $x = 3^{2^n}$, and show that $x^2 - 1$ is the sum of two squares by induction on $n$: if $3^{2^n} - 1 = a^2 + b^2$, then
    $$\begin{array}{l} (3 ^ {2 ^ {n + 1}} - 1) = (3 ^ {2 ^ {n}} - 1) (3 ^ {2 ^ {n}} + 1) \\ = (3 ^ {2 ^ {n - 1}} a + b) ^ {2} + (a - 3 ^ {2 ^ {n - 1}} b) ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}$$
  Fourth solution (by Jonathan Weinstein): Let $n = 4k^4 + 4k^2 = (2k^2)^2 + (2k)^2$ for any integer $k$. Then $n + 1 = (2k^2 + 1)^2 + 0^2$ and $n + 2 = (2k^2 + 1)^2 + 1^2$.

## A-3 The maximum area is $3\sqrt{5}$.

  We deduce from the area of $P_{1}P_{3}P_{5}P_{7}$ that the radius of the circle is $\sqrt{5 / 2}$. An easy calculation using the
  Pythagorean Theorem then shows that the rectangle $P_{2}P_{4}P_{6}P_{8}$ has sides $\sqrt{2}$ and $2\sqrt{2}$. For notational ease, denote the area of a polygon by putting brackets around the name of the polygon.

  By symmetry, the area of the octagon can be expressed as

        $$\left[ P _ {2} P _ {4} P _ {6} P _ {8} \right] + 2 \left[ P _ {2} P _ {3} P _ {4} \right] + 2 \left[ P _ {4} P _ {5} P _ {6} \right].$$
  Note that $[P_2P_3P_4]$ is $\sqrt{2}$ times the distance from $P_3$ to $P_2P_4$, which is maximized when $P_3$ lies on the midpoint of arc $P_2P_4$; similarly, $[P_4P_5P_6]$ is $\sqrt{2}/2$ times the distance from $P_5$ to $P_4P_6$, which is maximized when $P_5$ lies on the midpoint of arc $P_4P_6$. Thus the area of the octagon is maximized when $P_3$ is the midpoint of arc $P_2P_4$ and $P_5$ is the midpoint of arc $P_4P_6$. In this case, it is easy to calculate that $[P_2P_3P_4] = \sqrt{5} - 1$ and $[P_4P_5P_6] = \sqrt{5}/2 - 1$, and so the area of the octagon is $3\sqrt{5}$.

## A-4 To avoid some improper integrals at $0$, we may as well replace the left endpoint of integration by some $\varepsilon > 0$. We now use integration by parts:

    $$\begin{array}{l} \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \sin x \sin x ^ {2} d x = \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \frac{\sin x}{2 x} \sin x ^ {2} (2 \text{xdx}) \\ = - \frac{\sin x}{2 x} \cos x ^ {2} \Bigg | _ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \\ + \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \left(\frac{\cos x}{2 x} - \frac{\sin x}{2 x ^ {2}}\right) \cos x ^ {2} d x. \\ \end{array}$$
  Now $\frac{\sin x}{2x}\cos x^2$ tends to 0 as $B \to \infty$, and the integral of $\frac{\sin x}{2x^2}\cos x^2$ converges absolutely by comparison with $1/x^2$. Thus it suffices to note that
    $$\begin{array}{l} \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \frac{\cos x}{2 x} \cos x ^ {2} d x = \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \frac{\cos x}{4 x ^ {2}} \cos x ^ {2} (2 \text{xdx}) \\ = \left. \frac{\cos x}{4 x ^ {2}} \sin x ^ {2} \right| _ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \\ - \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \frac{2 x \cos x - \sin x}{4 x ^ {3}} \sin x ^ {2} d x, \\ \end{array}$$
  and that the final integral converges absolutely by comparison to $1/x^3$.
  An alternate approach is to first rewrite $\sin x \sin x^2$ as $\frac{1}{2} (\cos (x^{2} - x) - \cos (x^{2} + x))$. Then
      $$\begin{array}{l} \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \cos (x ^ {2} + x) d x = - \left. \frac{\sin (x ^ {2} + x)}{2 x + 1} \right| _ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \\ - \int_ {\varepsilon} ^ {B} \frac{2 \sin (x ^ {2} + x)}{(2 x + 1) ^ {2}} d x \\ \end{array}$$
