# Putting It All Together

The structure of the search results can be examined with your browser tools, as shown here:

Here, we see that the search results are structured as links whose parent element is a <h3> tag with class "r".
To scrape the search results, we will use a CSS selector, which was introduced in Chapter 2, Scraping the Data:

  ```
>>> from lxml.html import fromstring
>>> import requests
>>> html = requests.get('https://www.google.com/search?q=test')
>>> tree = fromstring(htl(content)
>>> results = tree.cssselect('h3.r a')
>>> results
[Element a at 0x7f3d9affea8],
Element a at 0x7f3d9affe890],
Element a at 0x7f3d9affe8e8],
Element a at 0x7f3d9affea0'],
Element a at 0x7f3d9b1a9e68],
Element a at 0x7f3d9b1a9c58],
Element a at 0x7f3d9b1a9ec0],
Element a at 0x7f3d9b1a9f18],
Element a at 0x7f3d9b1a9f70],
Element a at 0x7f3d9b1a9fc8]
```
