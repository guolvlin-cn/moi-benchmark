Figure 11-4. High-side Switching with an NPNBJT Driving a PNPBJT

Low-side switching (Recipe 11.1) is the most common and simplest arrangement, and unless you have a good reason such as the need for one end of the load to be connected to ground, you should use low-side switching.

GPIO ports and their output logic are described in Recipe 10.7.

You will find an example of switching with a transistor using an Arduino in Recipe 11.6 and for a Raspberry Pi in Recipe 11.7.

For switching using a MOSFET, see Recipe 11.3.

## 11.3 Switch Much More Power

Problem

You want to allow a GPIO pin to control more power than it otherwise could, but a BJT isn't enough.

Solution

You can use a MOSFET as an electronic switch. Use the transistor in a common-source arrangement. Figure 11-5 shows the schematic for this circuit. Along with Recipe 11.1, you will find yourself using this circuit a lot.

This type of switching is called "low-side" switching because the transistor acts as a switch between the low voltage of GND and the load.

If the GPIO pin is high (3.3V or 5V) and exceeds the gate-threshold voltage of the MOSFET, the MOSFET will turn on, allowing current to flow from +V through the load to GND.
