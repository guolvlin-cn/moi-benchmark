# Divisibility and Primes

## 1.1 Division Algorithm

Divisibility is a fundamental concept in number theory. Let a and d be integers. We say that d is a divisor of a , and that a is a multiple of d , if there exists an integer q such that

  $$a = d q.$$
If d divides a , we write

      $$d \mid a.$$
For example, 1001 is divisible by 7 and 13. Divisibility is transitive: If a divides b and b divides c , then a divides c (Exercise 14).

  The $minimum\ principle$ states that every nonempty set of integers bounded below contains a smallest element. For example, a nonempty set of nonnegative integers must contain a smallest element. We can see the necessity of the condition that the nonempty set be bounded below by considering the example of the set $\mathbf{Z}$ of all integers, positive, negative, and zero.
  The minimum principle is all we need to prove the following important result.

Theorem 1.1 (Division algorithm) Let $a$ and $d$ be integers with $d \geq 1$.
There exist unique integers q and r such that

    $$a = d q + r \tag{1.1}$$
and

$$0 \leq r \leq d - 1. \tag{1.2}$$
