#   7.2 Matrix Multiplication

Parallel processing of products on the computer is facilitated by a variant of (3) for computing $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$, which is used by standard algorithms (such as in Lapack). In this method, $\mathbf{A}$ is used as given, $\mathbf{B}$ is taken in terms of its column vectors, and the product is computed columnwise; thus,
(5) $\mathbf{AB} = \mathbf{A}[\mathbf{b}_1 \mathbf{b}_2 \dots \mathbf{b}_p] = [\mathbf{Ab}_1 \mathbf{Ab}_2 \dots \mathbf{Ab}_p]$.
Columns of $\mathbf{B}$ are then assigned to different processors (individually or several to each processor), which simultaneously compute the columns of the product matrix $\mathbf{Ab}_1$, $\mathbf{Ab}_2$, etc.
