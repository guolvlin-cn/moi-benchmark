B-2 Put $B = \max_{0 \leq x \leq 1} |f'(x)|$ and $g(x) = \int_0^x f(y) dy$. Since $g(0) = g(1) = 0$, the maximum value of $|g(x)|$ must occur at a critical point $y \in (0, 1)$ satisfying $g'(y) = f(y) = 0$. We may thus take $\alpha = y$ hereafter.
    Since $\int_0^\alpha f(x)dx = -\int_0^{1-\alpha}f(1-x)dx$, we may assume that $\alpha \leq 1/2$. By then substituting $-f(x)$ for $f(x)$ if needed, we may assume that $\int_0^\alpha f(x)dx \geq 0$. From the inequality $f'(x) \geq -B$, we deduce $f(x) \leq B(\alpha - x)$ for $0 \leq x \leq \alpha$, so
          $$\begin{array}{l} \int_ {0} ^ {\alpha} f (x) d x \leq \int_ {0} ^ {\alpha} B (\alpha - x) d x \\ = - \frac{1}{2} B (\alpha - x) ^ {2} \Bigg | _ {0} ^ {\alpha} \\ = \frac{\alpha^ {2}}{2} B \leq \frac{1}{8} B \\ \end{array}$$
    as desired.

B-3 First solution: Observing that $x_2/2 = 13$, $x_3/4 = 34$, $x_4/8 = 89$, we guess that $x_n = 2^{n-1}F_{2n+3}$, where $F_k$ is the $k$-th Fibonacci number. Thus we claim that $x_n = \frac{2^{n-1}}{\sqrt{5}} (\alpha^{2n+3} - \alpha^{-(2n+3)})$, where $\alpha = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, to make the answer $x_{2007} = \frac{2^{2006}}{\sqrt{5}} (\alpha^{3997} - \alpha^{-3997})$.
    We prove the claim by induction; the base case $x_0 = 1$ is true, and so it suffices to show that the recursion $x_{n + 1} = 3x_{n} + \lfloor x_{n}\sqrt{5}\rfloor$ is satisfied for our formula for $x_{n}$ . Indeed, since $\alpha^2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ , we have
  $$\begin{array}{l} x _ {n + 1} - (3 + \sqrt{5}) x _ {n} = \frac{2 ^ {n - 1}}{\sqrt{5}} (2 (\alpha^ {2 n + 5} - \alpha^ {- (2 n + 5)}) \\ - (3 + \sqrt{5}) (\alpha^ {2 n + 3} - \alpha^ {- (2 n + 3)})) \\ = 2 ^ {n} \alpha^ {- (2 n + 3)}. \\ \end{array}$$
    Now $2^{n}\alpha^{-(2n + 3)} = (\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})^{3}(3 - \sqrt{5})^{n}$ is between $-1$ and $0$; the recursion follows since $x_{n}, x_{n + 1}$ are integers.
    Second solution: (by Catalin Zara) Since $x_{n}$ is rational, we have $0 < x_{n}\sqrt{5} -\lfloor x_{n}\sqrt{5}\rfloor < 1$. We now have the inequalities
        $$x _ {n + 1} - 3 x _ {n} <   x _ {n} \sqrt{5} <   x _ {n + 1} - 3 x _ {n} + 1$$
        $$(3 + \sqrt{5}) x _ {n} - 1 <   x _ {n + 1} <   (3 + \sqrt{5}) x _ {n}$$
      $$4 x _ {n} - (3 - \sqrt{5}) <   (3 - \sqrt{5}) x _ {n + 1} <   4 x _ {n}$$
    $$3 x _ {n + 1} - 4 x _ {n} <   x _ {n + 1} \sqrt{5} <   3 x _ {n + 1} - 4 x _ {n} + (3 - \sqrt{5}).$$
    Since $0 < 3 - \sqrt{5} < 1$, this yields $\lfloor x_{n + 1}\sqrt{5}\rfloor = 3x_{n + 1} - 4x_{n}$, so we can rewrite the recursion as $x_{n + 1} = 6x_{n} - 4x_{n - 1}$ for $n\geq 2$. It is routine to solve this recursion to obtain the same solution as above.
    Remark: With an initial 1 prepaid, this becomes sequence A018903 in Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences: (http://www.researchAtt.com/~njas/

  sequences/). Therein, the sequence is described as the case $S(1,5)$ of the sequence $S(a_0,a_1)$ in which $a_{n+2}$ is the least integer for which $a_{n+2}/a_{n+1} > a_{n+1}/a_n$. Sloane cites D.

B-4 The number of pairs is 2^{n + 1} . The degree condition forces P to have degree n and leading coefficient \pm 1 ; we may count pairs in which P has leading coefficient 1 as long as we multiply by 2 afterward.

  Factor both sides:

      $$\begin{array}{l} (P (X) + Q (X) i) (P (X) - Q (X) i) \\ = \prod_ {j = 0} ^ {n - 1} (X - \exp (2 \pi i (2 j + 1) / (4 n))) \\ \cdot \prod_ {j = 0} ^ {n - 1} (X + \exp (2 \pi i (2 j + 1) / (4 n))). \\ \end{array}$$
  Then each choice of $P, Q$ corresponds to equating $P(X) + Q(X)i$ with the product of some $n$ factors on the right, in which we choose exactly one of the two factors for each $j = 0, \dots, n - 1$. (We must take exactly $n$ factors because as a polynomial in $X$ with complex coefficients, $P(X) + Q(X)i$ has degree exactly $n$. We must choose one for each $j$ to ensure that $P(X) + Q(X)i$ and $P(X) - Q(X)i$ are complex conjugates, so that $P, Q$ have real coefficients.) Thus there are $2^n$ such pairs; multiplying by $2$ to allow $P$ to have leading coefficient $-1$ yields the desired result.
  Remark: If we allow $P$ and $Q$ to have complex coefficients but still require $\text{deg}(P) > \text{deg}(Q)$, then the number of pairs increases to $2\binom{2n}{n}$, as we may choose any $n$ of the $2n$ factors of $X^{2n} + 1$ to use to form $P(X) + Q(X)i$.
B-5 For $n$ an integer, we have $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor = \frac{n - j}{k}$ for $j$ the unique integer in $\{0, \ldots, k - 1\}$ congruent to $n$ modulo $k$; hence
        $$\prod_ {j = 0} ^ {k - 1} \left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor - \frac{n - j}{k}\right) = 0.$$
  By expanding this out, we obtain the desired polynomials $P_0(n),\ldots ,P_{k - 1}(n)$
  Remark: Variants of this solution are possible that construct the $P_{i}$ less explicitly, using Lagrange interpolation or Vandermonde determinants.

B-6 (Suggested by Oleg Golberg) Assume $n \geq 2$, or else the problem is trivially false. Throughout this proof, any $C_i$ will be a positive constant whose exact value is immaterial. As in the proof of Stirling's approximation, we estimate for any fixed $c \in \mathbb{R}$,
    $$\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} (i + c) \log i = \frac{1}{2} n ^ {2} \log n - \frac{1}{4} n ^ {2} + O (n \log n)$$
