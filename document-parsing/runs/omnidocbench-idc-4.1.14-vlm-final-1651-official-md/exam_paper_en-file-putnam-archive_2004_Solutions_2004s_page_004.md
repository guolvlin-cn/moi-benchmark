  or in other words

    $$\left(1 - \frac{1}{m + n}\right) ^ {m + n - 1} <   \left(1 - \frac{1}{n}\right) ^ {n - 1}.$$
  To show this, we check that the function $f(x) = (1 - 1/x)^{x-1}$ is strictly decreasing for $x > 1$; while this can be achieved using the weighted arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, we give a simple calculus proof instead. The derivative of $\log f(x)$ is $\log(1 - 1/x) + 1/x$, so it is enough to check that this is negative for $x > 1$. An equivalent statement is that $\log(1 - x) + x < 0$ for $0 < x < 1$; this in turn holds because the function $g(x) = \log(1 - x) + x$ tends to $0$ as $x \to 0^+$ and has derivative $1 - \frac{1}{1 - x} < 0$ for $0 < x < 1$.
B-3 The answer is $\{a|a > 2\}$. If $a > 2$, then the function $f(x) = 2a/(a - 2)$ has the desired property; both perimeter and area of $R$ in this case are $2a^2/(a - 2)$. Now suppose that $a \leq 2$, and let $f(x)$ be a nonnegative continuous function on $[0, a]$. Let $P = (x_0, y_0)$ be a point on the graph of $f(x)$ with maximal $y$-coordinate; then the area of $R$ is at most $ay_0$ since it lies below the line $y = y_0$. On the other hand, the points $(0, 0)$, $(a, 0)$, and $P$ divide the boundary of $R$ into three sections. The length of the section between $(0, 0)$ and $P$ is at least the distance between $(0, 0)$ and $P$, which is at least $y_0$; the length of the section between $P$ and $(a, 0)$ is similarly at least $y_0$; and the length of the section between $(0, 0)$ and $(a, 0)$ is $a$. Since $a \leq 2$, we have $2y_0 + a > ay_0$ and hence the perimeter of $R$ is strictly greater than the area of $R$.
B-4 First solution: Identify the $xy$-plane with the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$, so that $P_k$ is the real number $k$. If $z$ is sent to $z'$ by a counterclockwise rotation by $\theta$ about $P_k$, then $z' - k = e^{i\theta}(z - k)$; hence the rotation $R_k$ sends $z$ to $\zeta z + k(1 - \zeta)$, where $\zeta = e^{2\pi i / n}$. It follows that $R_1$ followed by $R_2$ sends $z$ to $\zeta (\zeta z + (1 - \zeta)) + 2(1 - \zeta) = \zeta^2 z + (1 - \zeta)(\zeta + 2)$, and so forth; an easy induction shows that $R$ sends $z$ to
  $$\zeta^ {n} z + (1 - \zeta) (\zeta^ {n - 1} + 2 \zeta^ {n - 2} + \dots + (n - 1) \zeta + n).$$
  Expanding the product $(1 - \zeta)(\zeta^{n - 1} + 2\zeta^{n - 2} + \dots + (n - 1)\zeta + n)$ yields $-\zeta^n - \zeta^{n - 1} - \dots - \zeta + n = n$. Thus $R$ sends $z$ to $z + n$; in cartesian coordinates, $R(x,y) = (x + n,y)$.
  Second solution: (by Andy Lutomirski, via Ravi Vakil) Imagine a regular n -gon of side length 1 placed with its top edge on the x -axis and the left endpoint of that edge at the origin. Then the rotations correspond to rolling this n -gon along the x -axis; after the n rotations, it clearly ends up in its original rotation and translated n units to the right. Hence the whole plane must do so as well.

  Third solution: (attribution unknown) Viewing each $R_{k}$ as a function of a complex number $z$ as in the first solution, the function $R_{n} \circ R_{n-1} \circ \dots \circ R_{1}(z)$ is linear in
    $z$ with slope $\zeta^n = 1$. It thus equals $z + T$ for some $T \in \mathbb{C}$. Since $f_1(1) = 1$, we can write $1 + T = R_n \circ \dots \circ R_2(1)$. However, we also have
            $$R _ {n} \circ \dots \circ R _ {2} (1) = R _ {n - 1} \circ R _ {1} (0) + 1$$
    by the symmetry in how the $R_{i}$ are defined. Hence

      $$R _ {n} (1 + T) = R _ {n} \circ R _ {1} (0) + R _ {n} (1) = T + R _ {n} (1);$$
    that is, $R_{n}(T) = T$. Hence $T = n$, as desired.

B-5 First solution: By taking logarithms, we see that the desired limit is $\exp(L)$, where

$L = \lim_{x\to 1^{-}}\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}x^{n}\left(\ln (1 + x^{n + 1}) - \ln (1 + x^{n})\right).$

Now
  $$\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {N} x ^ {n} \left(\ln \left(1 + x ^ {n + 1}\right) - \ln \left(1 + x ^ {n}\right)\right) \\ = 1 / x \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {N} x ^ {n + 1} \ln (1 + x ^ {n + 1}) - \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {N} x ^ {n} \ln (1 + x ^ {n}) \\ = x ^ {N} \ln (1 + x ^ {N + 1}) - \ln 2 + (1 / x - 1) \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {N} x ^ {n} \ln (1 + x ^ {n}); \\ \end{array}$$
    since $\lim_{N\to \infty}(x^N\ln (1 + x^{N + 1})) = 0$ for $0 < x < 1$, we conclude that $L = -\ln 2 + \lim_{x\to 1^{-}}f(x)$, where
        $$\begin{array}{l} f (x) = (1 / x - 1) \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} x ^ {n} \ln (1 + x ^ {n}) \\ = (1 / x - 1) \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {\infty} (- 1) ^ {m + 1} x ^ {n + m n} / m. \\ \end{array}$$
    This final double sum converges absolutely when 0 < x < 1 , since

          $$\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {\infty} x ^ {n + m n} / m = \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} x ^ {n} (- \ln (1 - x ^ {n})) \\ <   \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} x ^ {n} (- \ln (1 - x)), \\ \end{array}$$
    which converges. (Note that $-\ln(1 - x)$ and $-\ln(1 - x^n)$ are positive.) Hence we may interchange the summations in $f(x)$ to obtain
              $$\begin{array}{l} f (x) = (1 / x - 1) \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {\infty} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac{(- 1) ^ {m + 1} x ^ {(m + 1) n}}{m} \\ = (1 / x - 1) \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac{(- 1) ^ {m + 1}}{m} \left(\frac{x ^ {m} (1 - x)}{1 - x ^ {m + 1}}\right). \\ \end{array}$$
    This last sum converges absolutely uniformly in x , so it is legitimate to take limits term by term. Since
