  product of the orders of all of its elements cannot be a power of 2.

  We may thus consider only abelian 2-groups hereafter. For such a group $G$, the product of the orders of all of its elements has the form $2^{k(G)}$ for some nonnegative integer $G$, and we must show that it is impossible to achieve $k(G) = 2009$. Again by the structure theorem, we may write
          $$G \cong \prod_ {i = 1} ^ {\infty} (\mathbb{Z} / 2 ^ {i} \mathbb{Z}) ^ {e _ {i}}$$
  for some nonnegative integers $e_1, e_2, \ldots$, all but finitely many of which are 0.
  For any nonnegative integer $m$, the elements of $G$ of order at most $2^{m}$ form a subgroup isomorphic to
        $$\prod_ {i = 1} ^ {\infty} (\mathbb{Z} / 2 ^ {\min  \{i, m \}} \mathbb{Z}) ^ {e _ {i}},$$
  which has $2^{s_m}$ elements for $s_m = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \min \{i, m\} e_i$. Hence
      $$k (G) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {\infty} i \left(2 ^ {s _ {i}} - 2 ^ {s _ {i - 1}}\right).$$
  Since $s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \dots$, $k(G) + 1$ is always divisible by $2^{s_1}$. In particular, $k(G) = 2009$ forces $s_1 \leq 1$.
  However, the only cases where $s_1 \leq 1$ are where all of the $e_i$ are 0, in which case $k(G) = 0$, or where $e_i = 1$ for some $i$ and $e_j = 0$ for $j \neq i$, in which case $k(G) = (i - 1)2^i + 1$. The right side is a strictly increasing function of $i$ which equals 1793 for $i = 8$ and 4097 for $i = 9$, so it can never equal 2009. This proves the claim.
  Remark. One can also arrive at the key congruence by dividing $G$ into equivalence classes, by declaring two elements to be equivalent if they generate the same cyclic subgroup of $G$. For $h > 0$, an element of order $2^h$ belongs to an equivalence class of size $2^{h-1}$, so the products of the orders of the elements of this equivalence class is $2^j$ for $j = h2^{h-1}$. This quantity is divisible by 4 as long as $h > 1$; thus to have $k(G) \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, the number of elements of $G$ of order 2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 4. However, there are exactly $2^e - 1$ such elements, for $e$ the number of cyclic factors of $G$. Hence $e = 1$, and one concludes as in the given solution.
A-6 We disprove the assertion using the example

    $$f (x, y) = 3 (1 + y) (2 x - 1) ^ {2} - y.$$
  We have b - a = d - c = 0 because the identity f(x,y) = f(1 - x,y) forces a = b , and because

    $$\begin{array}{l} c = \int_ {0} ^ {1} 3 (2 x - 1) ^ {2} d x = 1, \\ d = \int_ {0} ^ {1} (6 (2 x - 1) ^ {2} - 1) d x = 1. \\ \end{array}$$
  Moreover, the partial derivatives

        $$\begin{array}{l} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \left(x _ {0}, y _ {0}\right) = 3 \left(1 + y _ {0}\right) \left(8 x _ {0} - 4\right) \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \left(x _ {0}, y _ {0}\right) = 3 \left(2 x _ {0} - 1\right) ^ {2} - 1. \\ \end{array}$$
  have no common zero in $(0,1)^2$. Namely, for the first partial to vanish, we must have $x_0 = 1/2$ since $1 + y_0$ is nowhere zero, but for $x_0 = 1/2$ the second partial cannot vanish.
  Remark. This problem amounts to refuting a potential generalization of the Mean Value Theorem to bivariate functions. Many counterexamples are possible. Kent Merryfield suggests $y \sin(2\pi x)$, for which all four of the boundary integrals vanish; here the partial derivatives are $2\pi y \cos(2\pi x)$ and $\sin(2\pi x)$. Catalin Zara suggests $x^{1/3} y^{2/3}$. Qingchun Ren suggests $xy(1 - y)$.
B-1 Every positive rational number can be uniquely written in lowest terms as $a/b$ for $a,b$ positive integers. We prove the statement in the problem by induction on the largest prime dividing either $a$ or $b$ (where this is considered to be 1 if $a = b = 1$). For the base case, we can write $1/1 = 2!/2!$. For a general $a/b$, let $p$ be the largest prime dividing either $a$ or $b$; then $a/b = p^k a'/b'$ for some $k \neq 0$ and positive integers $a', b'$ whose largest prime factors are strictly less than $p$. We now have $a/b = (p!)^k \frac{a'}{(p - 1)!^k b'}$, and all prime factors of $a'$ and $(p - 1)!^k b'$ are strictly less than $p$. By the induction assumption, $\frac{a'}{(p - 1)!^k b'}$ can be written as a quotient of products of prime factorials, and so $a/b = (p!)^k \frac{a'}{(p - 1)!^k b'}$ can as well. This completes the induction.

  Remark. Noam Elkies points out that the representations are unique up to rearranging and canceling common factors.

B-2 The desired real numbers $c$ are precisely those for which $1/3 < c \leq 1$. For any positive integer $m$ and any sequence $0 = x_0 < x_1 < \dots < x_m = 1$, the cost of jumping along this sequence is $\sum_{i=1}^{m} (x_i - x_{i-1}) x_i^2$. Since
      $$\begin{array}{l} 1 = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \left(x _ {i} - x _ {i - 1}\right) \geq \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \left(x _ {i} - x _ {i - 1}\right) x _ {i} ^ {2} \\ > \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \int_ {x _ {i}} ^ {x _ {i - 1}} t ^ {2} d t \\ = \int_ {0} ^ {1} t ^ {2} d t = \frac{1}{3}, \\ \end{array}$$
  we can only achieve costs $c$ for which $1/3 < c \leq 1$.
  It remains to check that any such $c$ can be achieved. Suppose $0 = x_0 < \dots < x_m = 1$ is a sequence with $m \geq 1$. For $i = 1, \ldots, m$, let $c_i$ be the cost of the sequence $0, x_i, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_m$. For $i > 1$ and $0 < y \leq x_{i-1}$, the cost of the sequence $0, y, x_i, \ldots, x_m$ is
    $$c _ {i} + y ^ {3} + (x _ {i} - y) x _ {i} ^ {2} - x _ {i} ^ {3} = c _ {i} - y \left(x _ {i} ^ {2} - y ^ {2}\right),$$
