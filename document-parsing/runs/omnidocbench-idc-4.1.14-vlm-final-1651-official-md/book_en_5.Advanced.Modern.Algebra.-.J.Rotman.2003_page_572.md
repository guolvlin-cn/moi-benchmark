ring, and Jacobson semisimple, by Corollary 8.35(ii)]. The factor module $J^q / J^{q+1}$ is an $(R/J)$-module; hence, by Corollary 8.43, $J^q / J^{q+1}$ is a semisimple module, and so it can be decomposed into a direct sum of (possibly infinitely many) simple $(R/J)$-modules. But there can be only finitely many summands, for every $(R/J)$-submodule of $J^q / J^{q+1}$ is necessarily an $R$-submodule, and $J^q / J^{q+1}$ has the DCC on $R$-submodules. Hence, there are simple $(R/J)$-modules $S_i$ with
      $$J ^ {q} / J ^ {q + 1} = S _ {1} \oplus S _ {2} \oplus \dots \oplus S _ {p}.$$
Throwing away one simple summand at a time yields a series of $J^q / J^{q+1}$ whose $i$th factor module is
    $$(S _ {i} \oplus S _ {i + 1} \oplus \dots \oplus S _ {p}) / (S _ {i + 1} \oplus \dots \oplus S _ {p}) \cong S _ {i}.$$
Now the simple $(R/J)$-module $S_i$ is also a simple $R$-module, for it is an $R$-module annihilated by $J$, so that we have constructed a composition series for $J^q / J^{q+1}$ as a left $R$-module. Finally, refine the original series for $R$ in this way, for every $q$, to obtain a composition series for $R$.
  Of course, the converse of Theorem 8.46 is false.

  The next result is fundamental.

Theorem 8.47 (Maschke's Theorem). If G is a finite group and k is a field whose characteristic does not divide |G| , then kG is a left semisimple ring.

Remark. The hypothesis always holds if k has characteristic 0.

Proof. By Proposition 8.42, it suffices to prove that every left ideal $I$ of $kG$ is a direct summand. Since $k$ is a field, $kG$ is a vector space over $k$ and $I$ is a subspace. By Corollary 6.49, $I$ is a (vector space) direct summand: There is a subspace $V$ (which may not be a left ideal in $kG$) with $kG = I \oplus V$. There is a $k$-linear transformation $d \colon kG \to I$ with $d(b) = b$ for all $b \in I$ and with $\ker d = V$ [each $u \in kG$ has a unique expression of the form $u = b + v$, where $b \in I$ and $v \in V$, and $d(u) = b$]. Were $d$ a $kG$-map, not merely a $k$-map, then we would be done, by the criterion of Corollary 7.17: $I$ is a summand of $kG$ if and only if it is a retract; that is, there is a $kG$-map $D \colon kG \to I$ with $D(u) = u$ for all $u \in I$. We now force $d$ to be a $kG$-map by an "averaging" process.
  Define $D: kG \to kG$ by
    $$D (u) = \frac{1}{| G |} \sum_ {x \in G} x d (x ^ {- 1} u)$$
for all $u \in kG$. Note that $|G| \neq 0$ in $k$, by the hypothesis on the characteristic of $k$, and so it is invertible. It is obvious that $D$ is a $k$-map.
(i) $\operatorname{im} D \subseteq I$.
  If $u \in kG$ and $x \in G$, then $d(x^{-1}u) \in I$ (because $\operatorname{im} d \subseteq I$), and $xd(x^{-1}u) \in I$ because $I$ is a left ideal. Therefore, $D(u) \in I$, for each term in the defining sum of $D(u)$ lies in $I$.
