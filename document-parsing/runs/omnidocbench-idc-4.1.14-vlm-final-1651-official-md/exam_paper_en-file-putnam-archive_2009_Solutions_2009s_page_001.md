## A-1 Yes, it does follow. Let P be any point in the plane. Let ABCD be any square with center P . Let E,F,G,H be the midpoints of the segments AB,BC,CD,DA , respectively. The function f must satisfy the equations

          $$0 = f (A) + f (B) + f (C) + f (D)$$
          $$0 = f (E) + f (F) + f (G) + f (H)$$
          $$0 = f (A) + f (E) + f (P) + f (H)$$
          $$0 = f (B) + f (F) + f (P) + f (E)$$
          $$0 = f (C) + f (G) + f (P) + f (F)$$
          $$0 = f (D) + f (H) + f (P) + f (G).$$
    If we add the last four equations, then subtract the first equation and twice the second equation, we obtain 0 = 4f(P) , whence f(P) = 0 .

    Remark. Problem 1 of the 1996 Romanian IMO team selection exam asks the same question with squares replaced by regular polygons of any (fixed) number of vertices.

## A-2 Multiplying the first differential equation by gh , the second by fh , and the third by fg , and summing gives

              $$(\text{fgh}) ^ {\prime} = 6 (\text{fgh}) ^ {2} + 6.$$
    Write $k(x) = f(x)g(x)h(x)$; then $k' = 6k^2 + 6$ and $k(0) = 1$. One solution for this differential equation with this initial condition is $k(x) = \tan(6x + \pi/4)$; by standard uniqueness, this must necessarily hold for $x$ in some open interval around $0$. Now the first given equation becomes
        $$\begin{array}{l} f ^ {\prime} / f = 2 k (x) + 1 / k (x) \\ = 2 \tan (6 x + \pi / 4) + \cot (6 x + \pi / 4); \\ \end{array}$$
    integrating both sides gives

  $$\ln (f (x)) = \frac{- 2 \ln \cos (6 x + \pi / 4) + \ln \sin (6 x + \pi / 4)}{6} + c,$$
    whence $f(x) = e^{c}\left(\frac{\sin(6x + \pi / 4)}{\cos^{2}(6x + \pi / 4)}\right)^{1 / 6}$. Substituting $f(0) = 1$ gives $e^{c} = 2^{-1 / 12}$ and thus $f(x) = 2^{-1 / 12}\left(\frac{\sin(6x + \pi / 4)}{\cos^{2}(6x + \pi / 4)}\right)^{1 / 6}$.
    Remark. The answer can be put in alternate forms using trigonometric identities. One particularly simple one is

      $$f (x) = (\sec 1 2 x) ^ {1 / 1 2} (\sec 1 2 x + \tan 1 2 x) ^ {1 / 4}.$$

## A-3 The limit is $0$; we will show this by checking that $d_{n} = 0$ for all $n \geq 3$. Starting from the given matrix, add the third column to the first column; this does not change the determinant. However, thanks to the identity $\cos x + \cos y = 2\cos \frac{x + y}{2}\cos \frac{x - y}{2}$, the resulting matrix has the form

    $$\left( \begin{array}{c c c} 2 \cos 2 \cos 1 & \cos 2 & \dots \\ 2 \cos (n + 2) \cos 1 & \cos (n + 2) & \dots \\ 2 \cos (2 n + 2) \cos 1 & 2 \cos (2 n + 2) & \dots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \end{array} \right)$$
  with the first column being a multiple of the second. Hence $d_{n} = 0$.
  Remark. Another way to draw the same conclusion is to observe that the given matrix is the sum of the two rank 1 matrices $A_{jk} = \cos(j-1)n\cos k$ and $B_{jk} = -\sin(j-1)n\sin k$, and so has rank at most 2. One can also use the matrices $A_{jk} = e^{i((j-1)n+k)}$, $B_{jk} = e^{-i(j-1)n+k}$.

## A-4 The answer is no; indeed, $S = \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{n + 2/5 \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ satisfies the given conditions. Clearly $S$ satisfies (a) and (b); we need only check that it satisfies (c). It suffices to show that if $x = p/q$ is a fraction with $(p,q) = 1$ and $p > 0$, then we cannot have $1/(x(x - 1)) = n + 2/5$ for an integer $n$. Suppose otherwise; then

      $$(5 n + 2) p (p - q) = 5 q ^ {2}.$$
  Since $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime, and $p$ divides $5q^2$, we must have $p \mid 5$, so $p = 1$ or $p = 5$. On the other hand, $p - q$ and $q$ are also relatively prime, so $p - q$ divides $5$ as well, and $p - q$ must be $\pm 1$ or $\pm 5$. This leads to eight possibilities for $(p,q)$: $(1,0)$, $(5,0)$, $(5,10)$, $(1,-4)$, $(1,2)$, $(1,6)$, $(5,4)$, $(5,6)$. The first three are impossible, while the final five lead to $5n + 2 = 16, -20, -36, 16, -36$ respectively, none of which holds for integral $n$.
  Remark. More generally, no rational number of the form $m/n$, where $m,n$ are relatively prime and neither of $\pm m$ is a quadratic residue mod $n$, need be in $S$. If $x = p/q$ is in lowest terms and $1/(x(x-1)) = m/n + k$ for some integer $k$, then $p(p-q)$ is relatively prime to $q^2$; $q^2/(p(p-q)) = (m+kn)/n$ then implies that $m+kn = \pm q^2$ and so $\pm m$ must be a quadratic residue mod $n$.

## A-5 No, there is no such group. By the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, G can be written as a product of cyclic groups. If any of these factors has odd order, then G has an element of odd order, so the
