## A-1 If $x$ and $y$ are the sides of two squares with combined area 1, then $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Suppose without loss of generality that $x \geq y$. Then the shorter side of a rectangle containing both squares without overlap must be at least $x$, and the longer side must be at least $x + y$. Hence the desired value of $A$ is the maximum of $x(x + y)$.

  To find this maximum, we let $x = \cos \theta$, $y = \sin \theta$ with $\theta \in [0, \pi/4]$. Then we are to maximize
    $$\begin{array}{l} \cos^ {2} \theta + \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{2} (1 + \cos 2 \theta + \sin 2 \theta) \\ = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos (2 \theta - \pi / 4) \\ \leq \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{2}, \\ \end{array}$$
  with equality for $\theta = \pi /8$. Hence this value is the desired value of $A$.

## A-2 Let $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ be the centers of $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ , respectively. (We are assuming $C_{1}$ has radius 1 and $C_{2}$ has radius 3.) Then the desired locus is an annulus centered at the midpoint of $O_{1}O_{2}$ , with inner radius 1 and outer radius 2.

  For a fixed point $Q$ on $C_2$, the locus of the midpoints of the segments $PQ$ for $P$ lying on $C_1$ is the image of $C_1$ under a homothety centered at $Q$ of radius $1/2$, which is a circle of radius $1/2$. As $Q$ varies, the center of this smaller circle traces out a circle $C_3$ of radius $3/2$ (again by homothety). By considering the two positions of $Q$ on the line of centers of the circles, one sees that $C_3$ is centered at the midpoint of $O_1O_2$, and the locus is now clearly the specified annulus.

## A-3 The claim is false. There are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways to choose 3 of the 6 courses; have each student choose a different set of 3 courses. Then each pair of courses is chosen by 4 students (corresponding to the four ways to complete this pair to a set of 3 courses) and is not chosen by 4 students (corresponding to the 3-element subsets of the remaining 4 courses).

  Note: Assuming that no two students choose the same courses, the above counterexample is unique (up to permuting students). This may be seen as follows: Given a group of students, suppose that for any pair of courses (among the six) there are at most 4 students taking both, and at most 4 taking neither. Then there are at most $120 = (4 + 4)\binom{6}{2}$ pairs $(s,p)$, where $s$ is a student, and $p$ is a set of two courses of which $s$ is taking either both or none. On the other hand, if a student $s$ is taking $k$ courses, then he/she occurs in $f(k) = \binom{k}{2} + \binom{6 - k}{2}$ such
    pairs $(s,p)$. As $f(k)$ is minimized for $k = 3$, it follows that every student occurs in at least $6 = \binom{3}{2} + \binom{3}{2}$ such pairs $(s,p)$. Hence there can be at most $120/6 = 20$ students, with equality only if each student takes 3 courses, and for each set of two courses, there are exactly 4 students who take both and exactly 4 who take neither. Since there are only 4 ways to complete a given pair of courses to a set of 3, and only 4 ways to choose 3 courses not containing the given pair, the only way for there to be 20 students (under our hypotheses) is if all sets of 3 courses are in fact taken. This is the desired conclusion.
    However, Robin Chapman has pointed out that the solution is not unique in the problem as stated, because a given selection of courses may be made by more than one student. One alternate solution is to identify the 6 courses with pairs of antipodal vertices of an icosahedron, and have each student pick a different face and choose the three vertices touching that face. In this example, each of 10 selections is made by a pair of students.

## A-4 In fact, we will show that such a function $g$ exists with the property that $(a,b,c) \in S$ if and only if $g(d) < g(e) < g(f)$ for some cyclic permutation $(d,e,f)$ of $(a,b,c)$. We proceed by induction on the number of elements in $A$. If $A = \{a,b,c\}$ and $(a,b,c) \in S$, then choose $g$ with $g(a) < g(b) < g(c)$, otherwise choose $g$ with $g(a) > g(b) > g(c)$.

    Now let $z$ be an element of $A$ and $B = A - \{z\}$. Let $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ be the elements of $B$ labeled such that $g(a_1) < g(a_2) < \dots < g(a_n)$. We claim that there exists a unique $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that $(a_i, z, a_{i+1}) \in S$, where hereafter $a_{n+k} = a_k$.
    We show existence first. Suppose no such $i$ exists; then for all $i, k \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, we have $(a_{i+k}, z, a_i) \notin S$. This holds by property 1 for $k = 1$ and by induction on $k$ in general, noting that
  $$\begin{array}{l} (a _ {i + k + 1}, z, a _ {i + k}), (a _ {i + k}, z, a _ {i}) \in S \\ \Rightarrow (a _ {i + k}, a _ {i + k + 1}, z), (z, a _ {i}, a _ {i + k}) \in S \\ \Rightarrow \left(a _ {i + k + 1}, z, a _ {i}\right) \in S. \\ \end{array}$$
    Applying this when $k = n$, we get $(a_{i-1}, z, a_i) \in S$, contradicting the fact that $(a_i, z, a_{i-1}) \in S$. Hence existence follows.
    Now we show uniqueness. Suppose $(a_{i},z,a_{i + 1})\in S$; then for any $j\neq i - 1,i,i + 1$, we have $(a_{i},a_{i + 1},a_{j}),(a_{j},a_{j + 1},a_{i})\in S$ by the assumption on $G$.
