## 10.4 Hybrid Optimization

Hybrid methods may be required to solve particularly difficult real-world optimization problems. Implementation of hybrid methods typically requires non-trivial scripting because hybrids generally require a custom optimization workflow process. To illustrate this point, we describe a hybrid optimization method to solve a parameter estimation problem arising in the context of a model for childhood infectious disease transmission.

  This parameter estimation model is a difficult nonconvex, nonlinear program for which no efficient solution algorithm exists to find global optima. To facilitate solution, the problem is reformulated using a MIP under-estimator and an NLP over-estimator. Information is exchanged between the two formulations, and the process is iterated until the two solutions converge.

  Example 10.A.14 provides a Pyomo script that implements the hybrid search. Note that some initialization code is omitted from this example for clarity. In this example, user-defined Python functions are used to organize and modularize the optimization workflow. For example, the optimization model in this application is constructed via a function, disease.md1. Example 10.A.14 includes a sketch of this function.

  Beyond the standard Pyomo model constructs, we observe the ability to dynamically augment Pyomo models with arbitrary data, e.g., the definition of the pts_LS and pts_LI attributes; these are not model components, but rather raw Python data types. Pyomo itself is unaware of of these attributes, but other components of a user-defined script can access and manipulate these attributes. Such a mechanism is invaluable when information is being propagated across disparate components of a
