        $$\frac{1 - 2 x + 2 x ^ {2}}{(1 - x) ^ {2} (1 - 2 x)} = \frac{A}{(1 - x) ^ {2}} + \frac{B}{1 - x} + \frac{C}{1 - 2 x}.$$
  (d) Expand each summand of the right hand side above as a power series to conclude that $a_{n} = 2^{n + 1} - (n + 1)$ for $n \geq 0$
. Given $k, m \in \mathbb{N}$ , use generating functions to compute the number of integer solutions of the equation $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k = m$ , such that $a_i \geq 1$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$ .
. Use generating functions to compute the number of nonnegative integer solutions of the equation $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 20$, satisfying $a_1 \geq 2$ and $a_3 \leq 7$.
5. A particle moves on the cartesian plane in such a way that from point $(a, b)$ it can go to either $(a + 1, b)$ or $(a, b + 1)$. Given $n \in \mathbb{N}$, let $a_{n}$ be the number of distinct ways the particle has to go from $A_{0}(0, 0)$ to $A_{n}(n, n)$, without ever touching a point $(x, y)$ situated above the bisector of odd quadrants (i.e., one such point for which $y > x$). In this respect, do the following items:

  (a) Let $A_k(k, k)$, with $0 \leq k < n$. Prove that there are exactly $a_k a_{n-1-k}$ distinct trajectories for the particle in which $A_k$ is the last point (before $A_n$) on the line $y = x$.
  (b) Conclude that $a_{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{k} a_{n-1-k}$ and, hence, that $a_{n} = C_{n}$ for $n \geq 1$, where $C_{n}$ is the $n$-th Catalan number.
    For the coming problem, the reader may find it convenient to read again the paragraph that precedes Example 1.15.

6. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , we let $a_{n}$ denote the number of partitions of $n$ in natural summands, none of which exceeds 3. The purpose of this problem is to compute $a_{n}$ as a function of $n$ , and to this end do the following items:

  (a) Show that, for |x| < 1 , one has

          $$\sum_ {n \geq 1} a _ {n} x ^ {n} = \frac{1}{(1 - x) (1 - x ^ {2}) (1 - x ^ {3})}.$$
  (b) Find $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ for which
      $$\frac{1}{(1 - x) (1 - x ^ {2}) (1 - x ^ {3})} = \frac{a}{(1 - x) ^ {3}} + \frac{b}{(1 - x) ^ {2}} + \frac{c}{1 - x ^ {2}} + \frac{d}{1 - x ^ {3}}.$$
  (c) Conclude that

          $$a _ {n} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \frac{1}{6} \binom{n + 2} {2} + \frac{1}{4} (n + 1) + \frac{7}{1 2}, \text{if} 6 \mid n \\ \frac{1}{6} \binom{n + 2} {2} + \frac{1}{4} (n + 1) + \frac{1}{4}, \text{if} 2 \mid n \text{but} 3 \nmid n \\ \frac{1}{6} \binom{n + 2} {2} + \frac{1}{4} (n + 1) + \frac{1}{3}, \text{if} 2 \nmid n \text{but} 3 \mid n \\ \frac{1}{6} \binom{n + 2} {2} + \frac{1}{4} (n + 1), \text{if} 2, 3 \nmid n \end{array} . \right.$$
