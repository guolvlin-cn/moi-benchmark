  $$S (\mathbf{x}) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x _ {2} + x _ {3} \\ x _ {3} \end{array} \right] \tag{4.62}$$
and

  $$T (\mathbf{x}) = \left[ \begin{array}{l} x _ {1} - x _ {2} \\ x _ {1} + x _ {3} \end{array} \right]. \tag{4.63}$$
Then Q = S + T and R = cT are the linear transformations given by

  $$Q (\mathbf{x}) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x _ {1} + x _ {3} \\ x _ {1} + 2 x _ {3} \end{array} \right] \tag{4.64}$$
and

  $$R (\mathbf{x}) = \left[ \begin{array}{l} c \left(x _ {1} - x _ {2}\right) \\ c \left(x _ {1} + x _ {3}\right) \end{array} \right]. \tag{4.65}$$
  With Definition 4.2.4 Theorems 4.2.8 and 4.2.9 lead to the following theorem.

Theorem 4.2.10. (The Linear Transformations from $U$ to $V$ Form a Vector Space, Which Is Isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}_{m,n}$). Let $L(U,V)$ denote the set of all linear transformations from an $n$-dimensional vector space $U$ to an $m$-dimensional vector space $V$, and let $A = (\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \dots, \mathbf{a}_n)$ be an ordered basis for $U$, $B = (\mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \dots, \mathbf{b}_m)$ an ordered basis for $V$, and $T_{A,B}$ the $m \times n$ matrix that represents any $T \in L(U,V)$ relative to these bases. Then
1. L(U, V) , together with addition and scalar multiple of transformations as in Definition 4.2.4, is a vector space.
2. The mapping $M$ from $L(U, V)$ to the vector space $\mathcal{M}_{m,n}$ of all $m \times n$ matrices given by $M(T) = T_{A,B}$ is linear and an isomorphism. Hence $L(U, V)$ is $mn$-dimensional.
Proof. 1. $L(U,V)$ is clearly nonempty: the zero mapping $O$ is in it. Theorem 4.2.9 shows that $L(U,V)$ is closed under addition and multiplication by scalars. The vector space axioms for $L(U,V)$ follow from the corresponding ones in $V$ for every $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbf{y} = T(\mathbf{x})$. In particular, the zero element is the zero mapping $O$, and the element $-T$ is the mapping $(-1)T$.
  2. Let $S, T \in L(U, V)$ and $a, b$ any scalars. Then, by Theorem 4.1.3, for all $\mathbf{x} \in U$, $\mathbf{y} = T(\mathbf{x})$ becomes in terms of coordinates $\mathbf{y}_B = T_{A,B}\mathbf{x}_A = M(T)\mathbf{x}_A$. Similarly $\mathbf{y} = (aS + bT)(\mathbf{x})$ becomes
  $$\mathbf{y} _ {B} = (a S + b T) _ {A, B} \mathbf{x} _ {A} = M (a S + b T) \mathbf{x} _ {A}. \tag{4.66}$$
