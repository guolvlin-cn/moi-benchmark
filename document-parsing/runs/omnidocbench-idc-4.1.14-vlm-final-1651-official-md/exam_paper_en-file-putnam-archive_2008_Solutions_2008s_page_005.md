  $w_{1},\ldots ,w_{n}$ be the projections of $e_1,\dots ,e_n$. If the desired condition is not achieved, we can choose $i,j$ such that
        $$\left| w _ {i} \right| ^ {2} <   \frac{1}{n} \left(\left| w _ {1} \right| ^ {2} + \dots + \left| w _ {n} \right| ^ {2}\right) <   \left| w _ {j} \right| ^ {2}.$$
  By precomposing with a suitable rotation that fixes $e_h$ for $h \neq i, j$, we can vary $|w_i|, |w_j|$ without varying $|w_i|^2 + |w_j|^2$ or $|w_h|$ for $h \neq i, j$. We can thus choose such a rotation to force one of $|w_i|^2, |w_j|^2$ to become equal to $\frac{1}{n}(|w_1|^2 + \dots + |w_n|^2)$. Repeating at most $n - 1$ times gives the desired configuration.
B-4 We use the identity given by Taylor's theorem:

          $$h (x + y) = \sum_ {i = 0} ^ {\deg (h)} \frac{h ^ {(i)} (x)}{i !} y ^ {i}.$$
  In this expression, $h^{(i)}(x)/i!$ is a polynomial in $x$ with integer coefficients, so its value at an integer $x$ is an integer.

  For $x = 0, \dots , p - 1$, we deduce that
        $$h (x + p) \equiv h (x) + p h ^ {\prime} (x) \pmod{p ^ {2}}.$$
  (This can also be deduced more directly using the binomial theorem.) Since we assumed $h(x)$ and $h(x + p)$ are distinct modulo $p^2$, we conclude that $h'(x) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$. Since $h'$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, we have $h'(x) \equiv h'(x + mp) \pmod{p}$ for any integer $m$, and so $h'(x) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ for all integers $x$.
  Now for $x = 0, \dots , p^2 - 1$ and $y = 0, \dots , p - 1$, we write
      $$h (x + y p ^ {2}) \equiv h (x) + p ^ {2} y h ^ {\prime} (x) \pmod{p ^ {3}}.$$
  Thus $h(x), h(x + p^2), \ldots, h(x + (p - 1)p^2)$ run over all of the residue classes modulo $p^3$ congruent to $h(x)$ modulo $p^2$. Since the $h(x)$ themselves cover all the residue classes modulo $p^2$, this proves that $h(0), \ldots, h(p^3 - 1)$ are distinct modulo $p^3$.
  Remark: More generally, the same proof shows that for any integers $d,e > 1$, $h$ permutes the residue classes modulo $p^d$ if and only if it permutes the residue classes modulo $p^e$. The argument used in the proof is related to a general result in number theory known as Hensel's lemma.
B-5 The functions f(x) = x + n and f(x) = -x + n for any integer n clearly satisfy the condition of the problem; we claim that these are the only possible f .

  Let $q = a/b$ be any rational number with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $b > 0$. For $n$ any positive integer, we have
    $$\frac{f \left(\frac{a n + 1}{b n}\right) - f \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)}{\frac{1}{b n}} = \text{bnf} \left(\frac{a n + 1}{b n}\right) - \text{nbf} \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)$$
  is an integer by the property of f . Since f is differentiable at a / b , the left hand side has a limit. It follows that for sufficiently large n , both sides must be

  equal to some integer $c = f^{\prime}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)$: $f\left(\frac{an + 1}{bn}\right) = f\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) + \frac{c}{bn}$. Now $c$ cannot be $0$, since otherwise $f\left(\frac{an + 1}{bn}\right) = f\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)$ for sufficiently large $n$ has denominator $b$ rather than $bn$. Similarly, $|c|$ cannot be greater than $1$: otherwise if we take $n = k|c|$ for $k$ a sufficiently large positive integer, then $f\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) + \frac{c}{bn}$ has denominator $bk$, contradicting the fact that $f\left(\frac{an + 1}{bn}\right)$ has denominator $bn$. It follows that $c = f^{\prime}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \pm 1$.
  Thus the derivative of $f$ at any rational number is $\pm 1$. Since $f$ is continuously differentiable, we conclude that $f'(x) = 1$ for all real $x$ or $f'(x) = -1$ for all real $x$. Since $f(0)$ must be an integer (a rational number with denominator 1), $f(x) = x + n$ or $f(x) = -x + n$ for some integer $n$.
  Remark: After showing that $f'(q)$ is an integer for each $q$, one can instead argue that $f'$ is a continuous function from the rationals to the integers, so must be constant. One can then write $f(x) = ax + b$ and check that $b \in \mathbb{Z}$ by evaluation at $a = 0$, and that $a = \pm 1$ by evaluation at $x = 1/a$.
B-6 In all solutions, let F_{n,k} be the number of k -limited permutations of \{1,\ldots ,n\} .

  First solution: (by Jacob Tsimerman) Note that any permutation is $k$-limited if and only if its inverse is $k$-limited. Consequently, the number of $k$-limited permutations of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ is the same as the number of $k$-limited involutions (permutations equal to their inverses) of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$.
  We use the following fact several times: the number of involutions of $\{1,\dots ,n\}$ is odd if $n = 0,1$ and even otherwise. This follows from the fact that non-involutions come in pairs, so the number of involutions has the same parity as the number of permutations, namely $n!$.
  For $n \leq k + 1$, all involutions are $k$-limited. By the previous paragraph, $F_{n,k}$ is odd for $n = 0, 1$ and even for $n = 2, \ldots, k + 1$.
  For $n > k + 1$, group the $k$-limited involutions into classes based on their actions on $k + 2, \ldots, n$. Note that for $C$ a class and $\sigma \in C$, the set of elements of $A = \{1, \ldots, k + 1\}$ which map into $A$ under $\sigma$ depends only on $C$, not on $\sigma$. Call this set $S(C)$; then the size of $C$ is exactly the number of involutions of $S(C)$. Consequently, $|C|$ is even unless $S(C)$ has at most one element. However, the element $1$ cannot map out of $A$ because we are looking at $k$-limited involutions. Hence if $S(C)$ has one element and $\sigma \in C$, we must have $\sigma(1) = 1$. Since $\sigma$ is $k$-limited and $\sigma(2)$ cannot belong to $A$, we must have $\sigma(2) = k + 2$. By induction, for $i = 3, \ldots, k + 1$, we must have $\sigma(i) = k + i$.
  If $n < 2k + 1$, this shows that no class $C$ of odd cardinality can exist, so $F_{n,k}$ must be even. If $n \geq 2k + 1$, the classes of odd cardinality are in bijection with $k$-limited involutions of $\{2k + 2, \dots, n\}$, so $F_{n,k}$ has the same parity as $F_{n - 2k - 1, k}$. By induction on $n$, we deduce the desired result.
