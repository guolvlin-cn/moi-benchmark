## A-1 Note that if r(x) and s(x) are any two functions, then

      $$\max  (r, s) = (r + s + | r - s |) / 2.$$
  Therefore, if F(x) is the given function, we have

  $$\begin{array}{l} F (x) = \max  \{- 3 x - 3, 0 \} - \max  \{5 x, 0 \} + 3 x + 2 \\ = (- 3 x - 3 + | 3 x + 3 |) / 2 \\ - (5 x + | 5 x |) / 2 + 3 x + 2 \\ = | (3 x + 3) / 2 | - | 5 x / 2 | - x + \frac{1}{2}, \\ \end{array}$$
  so we may set $f(x) = (3x + 3)/2$, $g(x) = 5x/2$, and $h(x) = -x + \frac{1}{2}$.

## A-2 First solution: First factor p(x) = q(x)r(x) , where q has all real roots and r has all complex roots. Notice that each root of q has even multiplicity, otherwise p would have a sign change at that root. Thus q(x) has a square root s(x) .

  Now write $r(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{k}(x - a_j)(x - \overline{a_j})$ (possible because $r$ has roots in complex conjugate pairs). Write $\prod_{j=1}^{k}(x - a_j) = t(x) + iu(x)$ with $t, x$ having real coefficients. Then for $x$ real,
    $$\begin{array}{l} p (x) = q (x) r (x) \\ = s (x) ^ {2} \left(t (x) + i u (x)\right) \left(\overline{{t (x) + i u (x)}}\right) \\ = (s (x) t (x)) ^ {2} + (s (x) u (x)) ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}$$
  Alternatively, one can factor r(x) as a product of quadratic polynomials with real coefficients, write each as a sum of squares, then multiply together to get a sum of many squares.)

  Second solution: We proceed by induction on the degree of $p$, with base case where $p$ has degree 0. As in the first solution, we may reduce to a smaller degree in case $p$ has any real roots, so assume it has none. Then $p(x) > 0$ for all real $x$, and since $p(x) \to \infty$ for $x \to \pm \infty$, $p$ has a minimum value $c$. Now $p(x) - c$ has real roots, so as above, we deduce that $p(x) - c$ is a sum of squares. Now add one more square, namely $(\sqrt{c})^2$, to get $p(x)$ as a sum of squares.

## A-3 First solution: Computing the coefficient of $x^{n+1}$ in the identity $(1 - 2x - x^2)\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}a_mx^m = 1$ yields the recurrence $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + a_{n-1}$; the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is then characterized by this recurrence and the initial conditions $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 2$.

  Define the sequence $\{b_n\}$ by $b_{2n} = a_{n-1}^2 + a_n^2$, $b_{2n+1} =$
    $a_{n}(a_{n - 1} + a_{n + 1})$. Then
      $$\begin{array}{l} 2 b _ {2 n + 1} + b _ {2 n} = 2 a _ {n} a _ {n + 1} + 2 a _ {n - 1} a _ {n} + a _ {n - 1} ^ {2} + a _ {n} ^ {2} \\ = 2 a _ {n} a _ {n + 1} + a _ {n - 1} a _ {n + 1} + a _ {n} ^ {2} \\ = a _ {n + 1} ^ {2} + a _ {n} ^ {2} = b _ {2 n + 2}, \\ \end{array}$$
    and similarly $2b_{2n} + b_{2n-1} = b_{2n+1}$, so that $\\backslash\{b_n\}\backslash\}$ satisfies the same recurrence as $\backslash\{a_n\}\backslash\}$. Since further $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2$ (where we use the recurrence for $\backslash\{a_n\}\backslash\}$ to calculate $a_{-1} = 0$), we deduce that $b_n = a_n$ for all $n$. In particular, $a_n^2 + a_{n+1}^2 = b_{2n+2} = a_{2n+2}$.
    Second solution: Note that

  $$\begin{array}{l} \frac{1}{1 - 2 x - x ^ {2}} \\ = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \left(\frac{\sqrt{2} + 1}{1 - (1 + \sqrt{2}) x} + \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{1 - (1 - \sqrt{2}) x}\right) \\ \end{array}$$
    and that

            $$\frac{1}{1 + (1 \pm \sqrt{2}) x} = \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {\infty} (1 \pm \sqrt{2}) ^ {n} x ^ {n},$$
    so that

        $$a _ {n} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \left((\sqrt{2} + 1) ^ {n + 1} - (1 - \sqrt{2}) ^ {n + 1}\right).$$
    A simple computation (omitted here) now shows that $a_{n}^{2} + a_{n + 1}^{2} = a_{2n + 2}$.
    Third solution (by Richard Stanley): Let $A$ be the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ . A simple induction argument shows that
          $$A ^ {n + 2} = \left( \begin{array}{c c} a _ {n} & a _ {n + 1} \\ a _ {n + 1} & a _ {n + 2} \end{array} \right).$$
    The desired result now follows from comparing the top left corner entries of the equality $A^{n + 2}A^{n + 2} = A^{2n + 4}$.

## A-4 Denote the series by $S$, and let $a_{n} = 3^{n} / n$. Note that

              $$\begin{array}{l} S = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {\infty} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac{1}{a _ {m} \left(a _ {m} + a _ {n}\right)} \\ = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {\infty} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac{1}{a _ {n} \left(a _ {m} + a _ {n}\right)}, \\ \end{array}$$
    where the second equality follows by interchanging m
