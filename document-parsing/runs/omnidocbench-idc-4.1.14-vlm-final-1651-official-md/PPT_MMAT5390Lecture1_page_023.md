#       What is a digital image?

■ Mathematical definition:
  ■ A 2D (grayscale) digital image is a 2D function defined on a 2D domain (usually rectangular domain):
          $$f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$$
  ■ f(x,y) is called the brightness/intensity/grey level;
  ■ (x,y) is the spatial coordinates of the image.
  ■ Thus, a 2D digital image looks like this:
        $$f (x, y) = \left[ \begin{array}{\text{ccc} c} f (1, 1) & f (1, 2) & \dots & f (1, N) \\ f (2, 1) & f (2, 2) & \dots & f (2, N) \\ \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\ f (N, 1) & f (N, 2) & \dots & f (N, N) \end{array} \right]$$
  ■ Each element in the matrix is called pixel (picture element);
  ■ Usually, $0 \leq f(x,y) \leq G - 1$ and $(N = 2^{n}, G = 2^{m})$.
