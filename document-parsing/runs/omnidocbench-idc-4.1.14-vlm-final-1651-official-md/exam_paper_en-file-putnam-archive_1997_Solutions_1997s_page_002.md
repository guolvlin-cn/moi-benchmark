  (by logarithmic differentiation) or equivalently,

  $$\begin{array}{l} (1 - t ^ {2}) f ^ {\prime} (t) = f (t) [ (n - 1 - r) (1 - t) - r (1 + t) ] \\ = f (t) \left[ (n - 1 - 2 r) - (n - 1) t \right] \\ \end{array}$$
  and then taking the coefficient of $t^k$ on both sides:

      $$\begin{array}{l} (k + 1) x _ {k + 2} - (k - 1) x _ {k} = \\ (n - 1 - 2 r) x _ {k + 1} - (n - 1) x _ {k}. \\ \end{array}$$
  In particular, the largest such $c$ is $n-1$, and $x_k = \binom{n-1}{k-1}$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,n$.
  Greg Kuperberg has suggested an alternate approach to show directly that $c = n - 1$ is the largest root, without computing the others. Note that the condition $x_{n + 1} = 0$ states that $(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})$ is an eigenvector of the matrix
          $$A _ {i j} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c} i & j = i + 1 \\ n - j & j = i - 1 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$$
  with eigenvalue c . By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, A has a unique eigenvector with positive entries, whose eigenvalue has modulus greater than or equal to that of any other eigenvalue, which proves the claim.

B-1 It is trivial to check that $\frac{m}{6n} = \left\{\frac{m}{6n}\right\} \leq \left\{\frac{m}{3n}\right\}$ for $1 \leq m \leq 2n$, that $1 - \frac{m}{3n} = \left\{\frac{m}{3n}\right\} \leq \left\{\frac{m}{6n}\right\}$ for $2n \leq m \leq 3n$, that $\frac{m}{3n} - 1 = \left\{\frac{m}{3n}\right\} \leq \left\{\frac{m}{6n}\right\}$ for $3n \leq m \leq 4n$, and that $1 - \frac{m}{6n} = \left\{\frac{m}{6n}\right\} \leq \left\{\frac{m}{3n}\right\}$ for $4n \leq m \leq 6n$. Therefore the desired sum is
      $$\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {2 n - 1} \frac{m}{6 n} + \sum_ {m = 2 n} ^ {3 n - 1} \left(1 - \frac{m}{3 n}\right) \\ + \sum_ {m = 3 n} ^ {4 n - 1} \left(\frac{m}{3 n} - 1\right) + \sum_ {m = 4 n} ^ {6 n - 1} \left(1 - \frac{m}{6 n}\right) = n. \\ \end{array}$$
B-2 It suffices to show that $|f(x)|$ is bounded for $x \geq 0$, since $f(-x)$ satisfies the same equation as $f(x)$. But then
    $$\begin{array}{l} \frac{d}{d x} \left((f (x)) ^ {2} + \left(f ^ {\prime} (x)\right) ^ {2}\right) = 2 f ^ {\prime} (x) \left(f (x) + f ^ {\prime \prime} (x)\right) \\ = - 2 x g (x) \left(f ^ {\prime} (x)\right) ^ {2} \leq 0, \\ \end{array}$$
  so that $(f(x))^2 \leq (f(0))^2 + (f'(0))^2$ for $x \geq 0$.
B-3 The only such n are the numbers 1-4, 20-24, 100-104, and 120-124. For the proof let

            $$H _ {n} = \sum_ {m = 1} ^ {n} \frac{1}{m}$$
  and introduce the auxiliary function

        $$I _ {n} = \sum_ {1 \leq m \leq n, (m, 5) = 1} \frac{1}{m}.$$
  It is immediate (e.g., by induction) that $I_{n} \equiv 1, -1, 1, 0, 0 \pmod{5}$ for $n \equiv 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \pmod{5}$ respectively, and moreover, we have the equality
      $$H _ {n} = \sum_ {m = 0} ^ {k} \frac{1}{5 ^ {m}} I _ {\lfloor n / 5 ^ {m} \rfloor},$$
  where $k = k(n)$ denotes the largest integer such that $5^k \leq n$. We wish to determine those $n$ such that the above sum has nonnegative 5-valuation. (By the 5-valuation of a number $a$ we mean the largest integer $\nu$ such that $a / 5^{\nu}$ is an integer.)
  If $\lfloor n / 5^k \rfloor \leq 3$, then the last term in the above sum has 5-valuation $-k$ since $I_1, I_2, I_3$ each have valuation 0; on the other hand, all other terms must have 5-valuation strictly larger than $-k$. It follows that $H_n$ has 5-valuation exactly $-k$; in particular, $H_n$ has nonnegative 5-valuation in this case if and only if $k = 0$, i.e., $n = 1, 2,$ or $3$.
  Suppose now that $\lfloor n / 5^k \rfloor = 4$. Then we must also have $20 \leq \lfloor n / 5^{k - 1} \rfloor \leq 24$. The former condition implies that the last term of the above sum is $I_4 / 5^k = 1 / (12 \cdot 5^{k - 2})$, which has 5-valuation $-(k - 2)$.
  It is clear that $I_{20} \equiv I_{24} \equiv 0 \pmod{25}$; hence if $\lfloor n / 5^{k - 1} \rfloor$ equals 20 or 24, then the second-to-last term of the above sum (if it exists) has valuation at least $-(k - 3)$. The third-to-last term (if it exists) is of the form $I_r / 5^{k - 2}$, so that the sum of the last term and the third to last term takes the form $(I_r + 1/12) / 5^{k - 2}$. Since $I_r$ can be congruent only to 0, 1, or -1 ($\bmod 5$), and $1/12 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, we conclude that the sum of the last term and third-to-last term has valuation $-(k - 2)$, while all other terms have valuation strictly higher. Hence $H_n$ has nonnegative 5-valuation in this case only when $k \leq 2$, leading to the values $n = 4$ (arising from $k = 0$), 20, 24 (arising from $k = 1$ and $\lfloor n / 5^{k - 1} \rfloor = 20$ and 24 resp.), 101, 102, 103, and 104 (arising from $k = 2$, $\lfloor n / 5^{k - 1} \rfloor = 20$) and 120, 121, 122, 123, and 124 (arising from $k = 2$, $\lfloor n / 5^{k - 1} \rfloor = 24$).
  Finally, suppose $\lfloor n / 5^k \rfloor = 4$ and $\lfloor n / 5^{k - 1} \rfloor = 21$, 22, or 23. Then as before, the first condition implies that the last term of the sum in $(*)$ has valuation $-(k - 2)$, while the second condition implies that the second-to-last term in the same sum has valuation $-(k - 1)$. Hence all terms in the sum $(*)$ have 5-valuation strictly higher than $-(k - 1)$, except for the second-to-last term, and therefore $H_n$ has 5-valuation $-(k - 1)$ in this case. In particular, $H_n$ is integral (mod 5) in this case if and only if $k \leq 1$, which gives the additional values $n = 21$, 22, and 23.
B-4 Let $s_k = \sum_{i} (-1)^i a_{k-1,i}$ be the given sum (note that $a_{k-1,i}$ is nonzero precisely for $i = 0, \ldots, \left\lfloor \frac{2k}{3} \right\rfloor$). Since
    $$a _ {m + 1, n} = a _ {m, n} + a _ {m, n - 1} + a _ {m, n - 2},$$
