      Therefore

        $$\begin{array}{l} (a _ {i}, z, a _ {i + 1}), (a _ {i + 1}, a _ {j}, a _ {i}) \in S \Rightarrow (a _ {j}, a _ {i}, z) \in S \\ (a _ {i}, z, a _ {j}), (a _ {j}, a _ {j + 1}, a _ {i}) \in S \Rightarrow (z, a _ {j}, a _ {j + 1}), \\ \end{array}$$
      so $(a_{j},z,a_{j + 1})\notin S$. The case $j = i + 1$ is ruled out by
    $$(a _ {i}, z, a _ {i + 1}), (a _ {i + 1}, a _ {i + 2}, a _ {i}) \in S \Rightarrow (z, a _ {i + 1}, a _ {i + 2}) \in S$$
      and the case j = i - 1 is similar.

      Finally, we put $g(z)$ in $(g(a_{n}), +\infty)$ if $i = n$, and $(g(a_{i}), g(a_{i+1}))$ otherwise; an analysis similar to that above shows that $g$ has the desired property.

A-5 (due to Lenny Ng) For $1 \leq n \leq p - 1$, $p$ divides $\binom{p}{n}$ and
            $$\begin{array}{l} \frac{1}{p} \binom{p} {n} = \frac{1}{n} \frac{p - 1}{1} \frac{p - 2}{2} \dots \frac{p - n + 1}{n - 1} \\ \equiv \frac{(- 1) ^ {n - 1}}{n} (\mathrm{mod} p), \\ \end{array}$$
      where the congruence $x \equiv y \pmod{p}$ means that $x - y$ is a rational number whose numerator, in reduced form, is divisible by $p$. Hence it suffices to show that
              $$\sum_ {n = 1} ^ {k} \frac{(- 1) ^ {n - 1}}{n} \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} p).$$
      We distinguish two cases based on p (mod 6). First suppose p = 6r + 1 , so that k = 4r . Then

  $$\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {4 r} \frac{(- 1) ^ {n - 1}}{n} = \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {4 r} \frac{1}{n} - 2 \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {2 r} \frac{1}{2 n} \\ = \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {2 r} \left(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n}\right) + \sum_ {n = 2 r + 1} ^ {3 r} \left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{6 r + 1 - n}\right) \\ = \sum_ {n = 2 r + 1} ^ {3 r} \frac{p}{n (p - n)} \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} p), \\ \end{array}$$
      since p = 6r + 1 .

      Now suppose p = 6r + 5 , so that k = 4r + 3 . A similar argument gives

$$\begin{array}{l} \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {4 r + 3} \frac{(- 1) ^ {n - 1}}{n} = \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {4 r + 3} \frac{1}{n} + 2 \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {2 r + 1} \frac{1}{2 n} \\ = \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {2 r + 1} \left(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n}\right) + \sum_ {n = 2 r + 2} ^ {3 r + 2} \left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{6 r + 5 - n}\right) \\ = \sum_ {n = 2 r + 2} ^ {3 r + 2} \frac{p}{n (p - n)} \equiv 0 (\mathrm{mod} p). \\ \end{array}$$
A-6 We first consider the case $c \leq 1/4$; we shall show in this case $f$ must be constant. The relation
          $$f (x) = f (x ^ {2} + c) = f ((- x) ^ {2} + c) = f (- x)$$
      proves that $f$ is an even function. Let $r_1 \leq r_2$ be the roots of $x^2 + c - x$, both of which are real. If $x > r_2$,
  define $x_0 = x$ and $x_{n + 1} = \sqrt{x_n - c}$ for each positive integer $x$. By induction on $n$, $r_2 < x_{n + 1} < x_n$ for all $n$, so the sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ tends to a limit $L$ which is a root of $x^{2} + c = x$ not less than $r_2$. Of course this means $L = r_2$. Since $f(x) = f(x_{n})$ for all $n$ and $x_{n}\to r_{2}$, we conclude $f(x) = f(r_{2})$, so $f$ is constant on $x\geq r_2$.
  If $r_1 < x < r_2$ and $x_n$ is defined as before, then by induction, $x_n < x_{n+1} < r_2$. Note that the sequence can be defined because $r_1 > c$; the latter follows by noting that the polynomial $x^2 - x + c$ is positive at $x = c$ and has its minimum at $1/2 > c$, so both roots are greater than $c$. In any case, we deduce that $f(x)$ is also constant on $r_1 \leq x \leq r_2$.
  Finally, suppose $x < r_1$. Now define $x_0 = x$, $x_{n+1} = x_n^2 + c$. Given that $x_n < r_1$, we have $x_{n+1} > x_n$. Thus if we had $x_n < r_1$ for all $n$, by the same argument as in the first case we deduce $x_n \to r_1$ and so $f(x) = f(r_1)$. Actually, this doesn't happen; eventually we have $x_n > r_1$, in which case $f(x) = f(x_n) = f(r_1)$ by what we have already shown. We conclude that $f$ is a constant function. (Thanks to Marshall Buck for catching an inaccuracy in a previous version of this solution.)
  Now suppose $c > 1/4$. Then the sequence $x_n$ defined by $x_0 = 0$ and $x_{n+1} = x_n^2 + c$ is strictly increasing and has no limit point. Thus if we define $f$ on $[x_0, x_1]$ as any continuous function with equal values on the endpoints, and extend the definition from $[x_n, x_{n+1}]$ to $[x_{n+1}, x_{n+2}]$ by the relation $f(x) = f(x^2 + c)$, and extend the definition further to $x < 0$ by the relation $f(x) = f(-x)$, the resulting function has the desired property. Moreover, any function with that property clearly has this form.
B-1 Let $[n]$ denote the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ , and let $f_{n}$ denote the number of minimal selfish subsets of $[n]$ . Then the number of minimal selfish subsets of $[n]$ not containing $n$ is equal to $f_{n - 1}$ . On the other hand, for any minimal selfish subset of $[n]$ containing $n$ , by subtracting 1 from each element, and then taking away the element $n - 1$ from the set, we obtain a minimal selfish subset of $[n - 2]$ (since 1 and $n$ cannot both occur in a selfish set). Conversely, any minimal selfish subset of $[n - 2]$ gives rise to a minimal selfish subset of $[n]$ containing $n$ by the inverse procedure. Hence the number of minimal selfish subsets of $[n]$ containing $n$ is $f_{n - 2}$ . Thus we obtain $f_{n} = f_{n - 1} + f_{n - 2}$ . Since $f_{1} = f_{2} = 1$ , we have $f_{n} = F_{n}$ , where $F_{n}$ denotes the $n$ th term of the Fibonacci sequence.

B-2 By estimating the area under the graph of $\ln x$ using upper and lower rectangles of width 2, we get
    $$\begin{array}{l} \int_ {1} ^ {2 n - 1} \ln \text{xdx} \leq 2 (\ln (3) + \dots + \ln (2 n - 1)) \\ \leq \int_ {3} ^ {2 n + 1} \ln \text{xdx}. \\ \end{array}$$
  Since $\int \ln x dx = x \ln x - x + C$, we have, upon exponen-
