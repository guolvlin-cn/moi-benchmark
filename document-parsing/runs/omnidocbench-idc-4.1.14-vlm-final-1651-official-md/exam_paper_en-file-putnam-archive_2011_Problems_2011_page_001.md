## A1 Define a $growing\ spiral$ in the plane to be a sequence of points with integer coordinates $P_0 = (0,0), P_1, \ldots, P_n$ such that $n \geq 2$ and:

    - the directed line segments $P_0P_1$, $P_1P_2$, $\ldots$, $P_{n-1}P_n$ are in the successive coordinate directions east (for $P_0P_1$), north, west, south, east, etc.;
    - the lengths of these line segments are positive and strictly increasing.
  [Picture omitted.] How many of the points $(x,y)$ with integer coordinates $0 \leq x \leq 2011, 0 \leq y \leq 2011$ cannot be the last point, $P_{n}$ of any growing spiral?

## A2 Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots$ be sequences of positive real numbers such that $a_1 = b_1 = 1$ and $b_n = b_{n-1}a_n - 2$ for $n = 2, 3, \ldots$. Assume that the sequence $(b_j)$ is bounded. Prove that

            $$S = \sum_ {n = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac{1}{a _ {1} \dots a _ {n}}$$
  converges, and evaluate S

## A3 Find a real number c and a positive number L for which

      $$\lim  _ {r \rightarrow \infty} \frac{r ^ {c} \int_ {0} ^ {\pi / 2} x ^ {r} \sin x d x}{\int_ {0} ^ {\pi / 2} x ^ {r} \cos x d x} = L.$$

## A4 For which positive integers $n$ is there an $n \times n$ matrix with integer entries such that every dot product of a row with itself is even, while every dot product of two different rows is odd?

## A5 Let $F:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}$ and $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be twice continuously differentiable functions with the following properties:

    - $F(u, u) = 0$ for every $u \in \mathbb{R}$;
    - for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ , $g(x) > 0$ and $x^2 g(x) \leq 1$ ;
    - for every $(u,\nu)\in \mathbb{R}^2$, the vector $\nabla F(u,\nu)$ is either $\mathbf{0}$ or parallel to the vector $\langle g(u), -g(v)\rangle$
  Prove that there exists a constant $C$ such that for every $n \geq 2$ and any $x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n + 1}\in \mathbb{R}$ we have
          $$\min  _ {i \neq j} | F (x _ {i}, x _ {j}) | \leq \frac{C}{n}.$$

## A6 Let G be an abelian group with n elements, and let

        $$\left\{g _ {1} = e, g _ {2}, \dots , g _ {k} \right\} \subsetneq G$$
  be a (not necessarily minimal) set of distinct generators of $G$. A special die, which randomly selects one of the elements $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_k$ with equal probability, is rolled $m$ times and the selected elements are multiplied to produce an element $g \in G$. Prove that there exists a real number $b \in (0, 1)$ such that
    $$\lim  _ {m \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{b ^ {2 m}} \sum_ {x \in G} \left(\operatorname{\text{Pro} b} (g = x) - \frac{1}{n}\right) ^ {2}$$
  is positive and finite.

## B1 Let $h$ and $k$ be positive integers. Prove that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there are positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that

        $$\varepsilon <   | h \sqrt{m} - k \sqrt{n} | <   2 \varepsilon .$$

## B2 Let $S$ be the set of all ordered triples $(p,q,r)$ of prime numbers for which at least one rational number $x$ satisfies $px^2 + qx + r = 0$. Which primes appear in seven or more elements of $S$?

## B3 Let f and g be (real-valued) functions defined on an open interval containing 0, with g nonzero and continuous at 0. If fg and f / g are differentiable at 0, must f be differentiable at 0?

## B4 In a tournament, $2011$ players meet $2011$ times to play a multiplayer game. Every game is played by all $2011$ players together and ends with each of the players either winning or losing. The standings are kept in two $2011 \times 2011$ matrices, $T = (T_{hk})$ and $W = (W_{hk})$. Initially, $T = W = 0$. After every game, for every $(h,k)$ (including for $h = k$), if players $h$ and $k$ tied (that is, both won or both lost), the entry $T_{hk}$ is increased by $1$, while if player $h$ won and player $k$ lost, the entry $W_{hk}$ is increased by $1$ and $W_{kh}$ is decreased by $1$.

  Prove that at the end of the tournament, $\operatorname*{det}(T + iW)$ is a non-negative integer divisible by $2^{2010}$.

## B5 Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots$ be real numbers. Suppose that there is a constant $A$ such that for all $n$,

    $$\int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac{1}{1 + (x - a _ {i}) ^ {2}}\right) ^ {2} d x \leq A n.$$
  Prove there is a constant B > 0 such that for all n ,

      $$\sum_ {i, j = 1} ^ {n} \left(1 + \left(a _ {i} - a _ {j}\right) ^ {2}\right) \geq B n ^ {3}.$$

## B6 Let $p$ be an odd prime. Show that for at least $(p + 1) / 2$ values of $n$ in $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, p - 1\}$ ,

    $$\sum_ {k = 0} ^ {p - 1} k! n ^ {k} \quad \text{isnotdivisibleby} p.$$
