  (by elementary algebra, or Cramer's rule), so the center of the circle is rational. This proves the desired result.

  Remark: The above solution is deliberately more verbose than is really necessary. A shorter way to say this is that any two distinct rational points determine a rational line (a line of the form ax + by + c = 0 with a, b, c rational), while any two nonparallel rational lines intersect at a rational point. A similar statement holds with the rational numbers replaced by any field.

  Remark: A more explicit argument is to show that the equation of the circle through the rational points $(x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),(x_{3},y_{3})$ is
      $$0 = \det  \left( \begin{array}{\text{ccc} c} x _ {1} ^ {2} + y _ {1} ^ {2} & x _ {1} & y _ {1} & 1 \\ x _ {2} ^ {2} + y _ {2} ^ {2} & x _ {2} & y _ {2} & 1 \\ x _ {3} ^ {2} + y _ {3} ^ {2} & x _ {3} & y _ {3} & 1 \\ x ^ {2} + y ^ {2} & x & y & 1 \end{array} \right)$$
  which has the form $a(x^{2} + y^{2}) + dx + ey + f = 0$ for $a, d, e, f$ rational. The center of this circle is $(-d / (2a), -e / (2a))$, which is again a rational point.

B-2 We claim that $F_{n}(x) = (\ln x - a_{n})x^{n} / n!$ , where $a_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 / k$ . Indeed, temporarily write $G_{n}(x) = (\ln x - a_{n})x^{n} / n!$ for $x > 0$ and $n \geq 1$ ; then $\lim_{x \to 0} G_{n}(x) = 0$ and $G_{n}'(x) = (\ln x - a_{n} + 1 / n)x^{n - 1} / (n - 1)! = G_{n - 1}(x)$ , and the claim follows by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and induction on $n$ .
  Given the claim, we have $F_{n}(1) = -a_{n} / n!$ and so we need to evaluate $-\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{a_n}{\ln n}$ . But since the function $1 / x$ is strictly decreasing for $x$ positive, $\sum_{k = 2}^{n}1 / k = a_{n} - 1$ is bounded below by $\int_2^n dx / x = \ln n - \ln 2$ and above by $\int_1^n dx / x = \ln n$ . It follows that $\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{a_n}{\ln n} = 1$ , and the desired limit is $-1$ .
B-3 The largest possible radius is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. It will be convenient to solve the problem for a hypercube of side length 2 instead, in which case we are trying to show that the largest radius is $\sqrt{2}$.
  Choose coordinates so that the interior of the hypercube is the set $H = [-1, 1]^4$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Let $C$ be a circle centered at the point $P$. Then $C$ is contained both in $H$ and its reflection across $P$; these intersect in a rectangular parallelepiped each of whose pairs of opposite faces are at most 2 unit apart. Consequently, if we translate $C$ so that its center moves to the point $O = (0, 0, 0, 0)$ at the center of $H$, then it remains entirely inside $H$.
  This means that the answer we seek equals the largest possible radius of a circle $C$ contained in $H$ and centered at $O$. Let $\nu_{1} = (\nu_{11},\dots,\nu_{14})$ and $\nu_{2} = (\nu_{21},\dots,\nu_{24})$ be two points on $C$ lying on radii perpendicular to each other. Then the points of the circle can be expressed as $\nu_{1}\cos \theta +\nu_{2}\sin \theta$ for $0\leq \theta < 2\pi$. Then $C$ lies in $H$ if and only if for each $i$, we have
    $$\left| v _ {1 i} \cos \theta + v _ {2 i} \sin \theta \right| \leq 1 \quad (0 \leq \theta <   2 \pi).$$
  In geometric terms, the vector $(\nu_{1i}, \nu_{2i})$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has dot product at most 1 with every unit vector. Since
this holds for the unit vector in the same direction as $(v_{1i}, v_{2i})$, we must have
      $$v _ {1 i} ^ {2} + v _ {2 i} ^ {2} \leq 1 \quad (i = 1, \dots , 4).$$
Conversely, if this holds, then the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the above analysis imply that C lies in H .

If r is the radius of C , then

        $$\begin{array}{l} 2 r ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {4} v _ {1 i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {4} v _ {2 i} ^ {2} \\ = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {4} \left(v _ {1 i} ^ {2} + v _ {2 i} ^ {2}\right) \\ \leq 4, \\ \end{array}$$
so $r \leq \sqrt{2}$. Since this is achieved by the circle through $(1, 1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 0, 1, 1)$, it is the desired maximum.
Remark: One may similarly ask for the radius of the largest $k$-dimensional ball inside an $n$-dimensional unit hypercube; the given problem is the case $(n,k) = (4,2)$. Daniel Kane gives the following argument to show that the maximum radius in this case is $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{n}{k}}$. (Thanks for Noam Elkies for passing this along.)
We again scale up by a factor of 2, so that we are trying to show that the maximum radius $r$ of a $k$-dimensional ball contained in the hypercube $[-1,1]^n$ is $\sqrt{\frac{n}{k}}$. Again, there is no loss of generality in centering the ball at the origin. Let $T:\mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a similitude carrying the unit ball to this embedded $k$-ball. Then there exists a vector $v_i\in \mathbb{R}^{k}$ such that for $e_1,\ldots ,e_n$ the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $x\cdot v_{i} = T(x)\cdot e_{i}$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^k$. The condition of the problem is equivalent to requiring $|v_i|\leq 1$ for all $i$, while the radius $r$ of the embedded ball is determined by the fact that for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^k$.
    $$r ^ {2} (x \cdot x) = T (x) \cdot T (x) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} x \cdot v _ {i}.$$
Let $M$ be the matrix with columns $\nu_{1},\ldots ,\nu_{k}$; then $MM^{T} = r^{2}I_{k}$ for $I_{k}$ the $k\times k$ identity matrix. We then have
  $$\begin{array}{l} k r ^ {2} = \operatorname{\text{Trac} e} \left(r ^ {2} I _ {k}\right) = \operatorname{\text{Trac} e} \left(M M ^ {T}\right) \\ = \operatorname{\text{Trac} e} (M ^ {T} M) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} | v _ {i} | ^ {2} \\ \leq n, \\ \end{array}$$
yielding the upper bound $r \leq \sqrt{\frac{n}{k}}$.
To show that this bound is optimal, it is enough to show that one can find an orthogonal projection of $\mathbb{R}^n$ onto $\mathbb{R}^k$ so that the projections of the $e_i$ all have the same norm (one can then rescale to get the desired configuration of $\nu_{1},\ldots ,\nu_{n}$ ). We construct such a configuration by a "smoothing" argument. Start with any projection. Let
