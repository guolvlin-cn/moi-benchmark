B-4 The maximum is $2^{k}$ , achieved for instance by the subspace

    $$\{(x _ {1}, \dots , x _ {n}) \in \mathbb{R} ^ {n}: x _ {1} = \dots = x _ {n - k} = 0 \}.$$
  First solution: More generally, we show that any affine $k$-dimensional plane in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can contain at most $2^k$ points in $Z$. The proof is by induction on $k+n$; the case $k=n=0$ is clearly true.
  Suppose that $V$ is a $k$-plane in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Denote the hyperplanes $\{x_n = 0\}$ and $\{x_n = 1\}$ by $V_0$ and $V_{1}$, respectively. If $V \cap V_0$ and $V \cap V_{1}$ are each at most $(k - 1)$-dimensional, then $V \cap V_0 \cap Z$ and $V \cap V_{1} \cap Z$ each have cardinality at most $2^{k - 1}$ by the induction assumption, and hence $V \cap Z$ has at most $2^{k}$ elements. Otherwise, if $V \cap V_0$ or $V \cap V_{1}$ is $k$-dimensional, then $V \subset V_0$ or $V \subset V_{1}$; now apply the induction hypothesis on $V$, viewed as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n - 1}$ by dropping the last coordinate.
  Second solution: Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ contained in a $k$-dimensional subspace of $V$. This is equivalent to asking that any $t_1, \ldots, t_{k+1} \in S$ satisfy a nontrivial linear dependence $c_1 t_1 + \cdots + c_{k+1} t_{k+1} = 0$ with $c_1, \ldots, c_{k+1} \in \mathbb{R}$. Since $t_1, \ldots, t_{k+1} \in \mathbb{Q}^n$, given such a dependence we can always find another one with $c_1, \ldots, c_{k+1} \in \mathbb{Q}$; then by clearing denominators, we can find one with $c_1, \ldots, c_{k+1} \in \mathbb{Z}$ and not all having a common factor.
  Let $\mathbb{F}_2$ denote the field of two elements, and let $\overline{S} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ be the reductions modulo 2 of the points of $S$. Then any $t_1, \ldots, t_{k+1} \in \overline{S}$ satisfy a nontrivial linear dependence, because we can take the dependence from the end of the previous paragraph and reduce modulo 2. Hence $\overline{S}$ is contained in a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$, and the latter has cardinality exactly $2^k$. Thus $\overline{S}$ has at most $2^k$ elements, as does $S$.
  Variant (suggested by David Savitt): if $\overline{S}$ contained $k + 1$ linearly independent elements, the $(k + 1) \times n$ matrix formed by these would have a nonvanishing maximal minor. The lift of that minor back to $\mathbb{R}$ would also not vanish, so $S$ would contain $k + 1$ linearly independent elements.
  Third solution: (by Catalin Zara) Let $V$ be a $k$-dimensional subspace. Form the matrix whose rows are the elements of $V \cap Z$; by construction, it has row rank at most $k$. It thus also has column rank at most $k$; in particular, we can choose $k$ coordinates such that each point of $V \cap Z$ is determined by those $k$ of its coordinates. Since each coordinate of a point in $Z$ can only take two values, $V \cap Z$ can have at most $2^k$ elements.
  Remark: The proposers probably did not realize that this problem appeared online about three months before the exam, at http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/ Forum/viewtopic.php?t=105991. (It may very well have also appeared even earlier.)

B-5 The answer is 1 / 16 .We have

          $$\begin{array}{l} \int_ {0} ^ {1} x ^ {2} f (x) d x - \int_ {0} ^ {1} x f (x) ^ {2} d x \\ = \int_ {0} ^ {1} \left(x ^ {3} / 4 - x (f (x) - x / 2) ^ {2}\right) d x \\ \leq \int_ {0} ^ {1} x ^ {3} / 4 d x = 1 / 1 6, \\ \end{array}$$
  with equality when f(x) = x / 2 .

B-6 First solution: We start with some easy upper and lower bounds on $a_{n}$. We write $O(f(n))$ and $\Omega (f(n))$ for functions $g(n)$ such that $f(n) / g(n)$ and $g(n) / f(n)$, respectively, are bounded above. Since $a_{n}$ is a nondecreasing sequence, $a_{n + 1} - a_{n}$ is bounded above, so $a_{n} = O(n)$. That means $a_{n}^{-1 / k} = \Omega (n^{-1 / k})$, so
        $$a _ {n} = \Omega \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} i ^ {- 1 / k}\right) = \Omega \left(n ^ {(k - 1) / k}\right).$$
  In fact, all we will need is that $a_n \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty.$
  By Taylor's theorem with remainder, for 1 < m < 2 and x > 0 ,

        $$\left| (1 + x) ^ {m} - 1 - m x \right| \leq \frac{m (m - 1)}{2} x ^ {2}.$$
  Taking $m = (k + 1) / k$ and $x = a_{n + 1} / a_n = 1 + a_n^{-(k + 1) / k}$ , we obtain
    $$\left| a _ {n + 1} ^ {(k + 1) / k} - a _ {n} ^ {(k + 1) / k} - \frac{k + 1}{k} \right| \leq \frac{k + 1}{2 k ^ {2}} a _ {n} ^ {- (k + 1) / k}.$$
  In particular,

          $$\lim  _ {n \rightarrow \infty} a _ {n + 1} ^ {(k + 1) / k} - a _ {n} ^ {(k + 1) / k} = \frac{k + 1}{k}.$$
  In general, if $x_{n}$ is a sequence with $\lim_{n\to \infty}x_n = c$, then also
              $$\lim  _ {n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} x _ {i} = c$$
  by Cesaro's lemma. Explicitly, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find $N$ such that $|x_{n} - c| \leq \varepsilon /2$ for $n \geq N$, and then
      $$\left| c - \frac{1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} x _ {i} \right| \leq \frac{n - N}{n} \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{N}{n} \left| \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} (c - x _ {i}) \right|;$$
  for $n$ large, the right side is smaller than $\varepsilon$.
  In our case, we deduce that

            $$\lim  _ {n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a _ {n} ^ {(k + 1) / k}}{n} = \frac{k + 1}{k}$$
and so

$$\lim  _ {n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a _ {n} ^ {k + 1}}{n ^ {k}} = \left(\frac{k + 1}{k}\right) ^ {k},$$
