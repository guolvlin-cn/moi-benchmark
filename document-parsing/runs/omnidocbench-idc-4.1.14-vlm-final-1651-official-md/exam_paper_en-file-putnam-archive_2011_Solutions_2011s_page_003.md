B1 Since the rational numbers are dense in the reals, we can find positive integers a,b such that

            $$\frac{3 \varepsilon}{h k} <   \frac{b}{a} <   \frac{4 \varepsilon}{h k}.$$
  By multiplying $a$ and $b$ by a suitably large positive integer, we can also ensure that $3a^2 > b$. We then have
      $$\frac{\varepsilon}{h k} <   \frac{b}{3 a} <   \frac{b}{\sqrt{a ^ {2} + b} + a} = \sqrt{a ^ {2} + b} - a$$
  and

    $$\sqrt{a ^ {2} + b} - a = \frac{b}{\sqrt{a ^ {2} + b} + a} \leq \frac{b}{2 a} <   2 \frac{\varepsilon}{h k}.$$
  We may then take $m = k^2(a^2 + b), n = h^2a^2$.
B2 Only the primes 2 and 5 appear seven or more times. The fact that these primes appear is demonstrated by the examples

        $$(2, 5, 2), (2, 5, 3), (2, 7, 5), (2, 1 1, 5)$$
  and their reversals.

  It remains to show that if either $\ell = 3$ or $\ell$ is a prime greater than $5$, then $\ell$ occurs at most six times as an element of a triple in $S$. Note that $(p,q,r) \in S$ if and only if $q^2 - 4pr = a^2$ for some integer $a$; in particular, since $4pr \geq 16$, this forces $q \geq 5$. In particular, $q$ is odd, as then is $a$, and so $q^2 \equiv a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$; consequently, one of $p, r$ must equal $2$. If $r = 2$, then $8p = q^2 - a^2 = (q + a)(q - a)$; since both factors are of the same sign and their sum is the positive number $2q$, both factors are positive. Since they are also both even, we have $q + a \in \{2, 4, 2p, 4p\}$ and so $q \in \{2p + 1, p + 2\}$. Similarly, if $p = 2$, then $q \in \{2r + 1, r + 2\}$. Consequently, $\ell$ occurs at most twice as many times as there are prime numbers in the list
          $$2 \ell + 1, \ell + 2, \frac{\ell - 1}{2}, \ell - 2.$$
  For $\ell = 3$, $\ell -2 = 1$ is not prime. For $\ell \geq 7$, the numbers $\ell -2$, $\ell$, $\ell +2$ cannot all be prime, since one of them is always a nontrivial multiple of 3.
  Remark. The above argument shows that the cases listed for 5 are the only ones that can occur. By contrast, there are infinitely many cases where 2 occurs if either the twin prime conjecture holds or there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes (both of which are expected to be true).

B3 Yes, it follows that f is differentiable.

  First solution. Note first that at $0$, $f/g$ and $g$ are both continuous, as then is their product $f$. If $f(0) \neq 0$, then in some neighborhood of $0$, $f$ is either always positive or always negative. We can thus choose $\varepsilon \in \{\pm 1\}$ so that $\varepsilon f$ is the composition of the differentiable function
    $(fg) \cdot (f / g)$ with the square root function. By the chain rule, $f$ is differentiable at 0.
    If f(0) = 0 , then (f / g)(0) = 0 , so we have

            $$(f / g) ^ {\prime} (0) = \lim  _ {x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f (x)}{x g (x)}.$$
    Since $g$ is continuous at $0$, we may multiply limits to deduce that $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x) / x$ exists.

    Second solution. Choose a neighborhood $N$ of $0$ on which $g(x) \neq 0$. Define the following functions on $N \setminus \{0\}$: $h_1(x) = \frac{f(x)g(x) - f(0)g(0)}{x}$; $h_2(x) = \frac{f(x)g(0) - f(0)g(x)}{xg(0)g(x)}$; $h_3(x) = g(0)g(x)$; $h_4(x) = \frac{1}{g(x) + g(0)}$. Then by assumption, $h_1, h_2, h_3, h_4$ all have limits as $x \to 0$. On the other hand,
      $$\frac{f (x) - f (0)}{x} = \left(h _ {1} (x) + h _ {2} (x) h _ {3} (x)\right) h _ {4} (x),$$
    and it follows that $\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x}$ exists, as desired.

  B4 Number the games $1, \ldots, 2011$, and let $A = (a_{jk})$ be the $2011 \times 2011$ matrix whose $jk$ entry is $1$ if player $k$ wins game $j$ and $i = \sqrt{-1}$ if player $k$ loses game $j$. Then $\overline{a_{hj}} a_{jk}$ is $1$ if players $h$ and $k$ tie in game $j$; $i$ if player $h$ wins and player $k$ loses in game $j$; and $-i$ if $h$ loses and $k$ wins. It follows that $T + iW = \overline{A}^T A$.
    Now the determinant of $A$ is unchanged if we subtract the first row of $A$ from each of the other rows, producing a matrix whose rows, besides the first one, are $(1 - i)$ times a row of integers. Thus we can write $\text{det} A = (1 - i)^{2010}(a + bi)$ for some integers $a, b$. But then $\text{det}(T + iW) = \text{det}(\bar{A}^T A) = 2^{2010}(a^2 + b^2)$ is a nonnegative integer multiple of $2^{2010}$, as desired.
  B5 Define the function

        $$f (y) = \int_ {- \infty} ^ {\infty} \frac{d x}{(1 + x ^ {2}) (1 + (x + y) ^ {2})}.$$
    For $y \geq 0$, in the range $-1 \leq x \leq 0$, we have
$$\begin{array}{l} (1 + x ^ {2}) (1 + (x + y) ^ {2}) \leq (1 + 1) (1 + (1 + y) ^ {2}) = 2 y ^ {2} + 4 y + 4 \\ \leq 2 y ^ {2} + 4 + 2 \left(y ^ {2} + 1\right) \leq 6 + 6 y ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}$$
    We thus have the lower bound

                $$f (y) \geq \frac{1}{6 (1 + y ^ {2})};$$
    the same bound is valid for $y \leq 0$ because $f(y) = f(-y)$ .
    The original hypothesis can be written as

              $$\sum_ {i, j = 1} ^ {n} f \left(a _ {i} - a _ {j}\right) \leq A n$$
    and thus implies that

          $$\sum_ {i, j = 1} ^ {n} \frac{1}{1 + (a _ {i} - a _ {j}) ^ {2}} \leq 6 A n.$$
