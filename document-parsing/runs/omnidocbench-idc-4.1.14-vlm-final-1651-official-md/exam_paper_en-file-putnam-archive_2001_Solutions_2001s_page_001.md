## A-1 The hypothesis implies $((b*a)*b)*(b*a) = b$ for all $a,b\in S$ (by replacing $a$ by $b*a$), and hence $a*(b*a) = b$ for all $a,b\in S$ (using $(b*a)*b = a$).

## A-2 Let $P_{n}$ denote the desired probability. Then $P_{1} = 1/3$ and, for $n > 1$,

    $$\begin{array}{l} P _ {n} = \left(\frac{2 n}{2 n + 1}\right) P _ {n - 1} + \left(\frac{1}{2 n + 1}\right) (1 - P _ {n - 1}) \\ = \left(\frac{2 n - 1}{2 n + 1}\right) P _ {n - 1} + \frac{1}{2 n + 1}. \\ \end{array}$$
  The recurrence yields $P_{2} = 2/5$, $P_{3} = 3/7$, and by a simple induction, one then checks that for general $n$ one has $P_{n} = n/(2n+1)$.
  Note: Richard Stanley points out the following noninductive argument. Put $f(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{n}(x + 2k) / (2k + 1)$; then the coefficient of $x^i$ in $f(x)$ is the probability of getting exactly $i$ heads. Thus the desired number is $(f(1) - f(-1)) / 2$, and both values of $f$ can be computed directly: $f(1) = 1$, and
        $$f (- 1) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{5} \times \dots \times \frac{2 n - 1}{2 n + 1} = \frac{1}{2 n + 1}.$$

## A-3 By the quadratic formula, if $P_{m}(x) = 0$, then $x^{2} = m \pm 2\sqrt{2m} + 2$, and hence the four roots of $P_{m}$ are given by $S = \{\pm \sqrt{m} \pm \sqrt{2}\}$. If $P_{m}$ factors into two nonconstant polynomials over the integers, then some subset of $S$ consisting of one or two elements form the roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients.

  First suppose this subset has a single element, say $\sqrt{m} \pm \sqrt{2}$; this element must be a rational number. Then $(\sqrt{m} \pm \sqrt{2})^2 = 2 + m \pm 2\sqrt{2m}$ is an integer, so $m$ is twice a perfect square, say $m = 2n^2$. But then $\sqrt{m} \pm \sqrt{2} = (n \pm 1)\sqrt{2}$ is only rational if $n = \pm 1$, i.e., if $m = 2$.
  Next, suppose that the subset contains two elements; then we can take it to be one of $\{\sqrt{m} \pm \sqrt{2}\}$, $\{\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{m}\}$ or $\{\pm (\sqrt{m} + \sqrt{2})\}$. In all cases, the sum and the product of the elements of the subset must be a rational number. In the first case, this means $2\sqrt{m} \in \mathbb{Q}$, so $m$ is a perfect square. In the second case, we have $2\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}$, contradiction. In the third case, we have $(\sqrt{m} + \sqrt{2})^2 \in \mathbb{Q}$, or $m + 2 + 2\sqrt{2m} \in \mathbb{Q}$, which means that $m$ is twice a perfect square.
  We conclude that $P_{m}(x)$ factors into two nonconstant polynomials over the integers if and only if $m$ is either a square or twice a square.

  Note: a more sophisticated interpretation of this argument can be given using Galois theory. Namely, if m

  is neither a square nor twice a square, then the number fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ are distinct quadratic fields, so their compositum is a number field of degree 4, whose Galois group acts transitively on $\{\pm \sqrt{m}\pm \sqrt{2}\}$. Thus $P_{m}$ is irreducible.

## A-4 Choose r,s,t so that EC = rBC,FA = sCA,GB = tCB, and let [XYZ] denote the area of triangle XYZ . Then [ABE] = [AFE] since the triangles have the same altitude and base. Also [ABE] = (BE / BC)[ABC] = 1 - r, and [ECF] = (EC / BC)(CF / CA)[ABC] = r(1 - s) (e.g., by the law of sines). Adding this all up yields

    $$\begin{array}{l} 1 = [ \text{ABE} ] + [ \text{ABF} ] + [ \text{ECF} ] \\ = 2 (1 - r) + r (1 - s) = 2 - r - r s \\ \end{array}$$
  or r(1 + s) = 1 . Similarly s(1 + t) = t(1 + r) = 1 .

  Let $f:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ be the function given by $f(x) = 1/(1+x)$; then $f(f(f(r))) = r$. However, $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing in $x$, so $f(f(x))$ is increasing and $f(f(f(x)))$ is decreasing. Thus there is at most one $x$ such that $f(f(f(x))) = x$; in fact, since the equation $f(z) = z$ has a positive root $z = (-1+\sqrt{5})/2$, we must have $r=s=t=z$.
  We now compute $[ABF] = (AF/AC)[ABC] = z$, $[ABR] = (BR/BF)[ABF] = z/2$, analogously $[BCS] = [CAT] = z/2$, and $[RST] = |[ABC] - [ABR] - [BCS] - [CAT]| = |1 - 3z/2| = \frac{7-3\sqrt{5}}{4}$.
  Note: the key relation r(1 + s) = 1 can also be derived by computing using homogeneous coordinates or vectors.

## A-5 Suppose $a^{n+1} - (a + 1)^n = 2001$. Notice that $a^{n+1} + [(a + 1)^n - 1]$ is a multiple of $a$; thus $a$ divides $2002 = 2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13$.

  Since 2001 is divisible by 3, we must have $a \equiv 1$ (mod 3), otherwise one of $a^{n+1}$ and $(a + 1)^n$ is a multiple of 3 and the other is not, so their difference cannot be divisible by 3. Now $a^{n+1} \equiv 1$ (mod 3), so we must have $(a + 1)^n \equiv 1$ (mod 3), which forces $n$ to be even, and in particular at least 2.
  If $a$ is even, then $a^{n+1} - (a + 1)^n \equiv -(a + 1)^n \pmod{4}$ . Since $n$ is even, $-(a + 1)^n \equiv -1 \pmod{4}$ . Since $2001 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ , this is impossible. Thus $a$ is odd, and so must divide $1001 = 7 \times 11 \times 13$ . Moreover, $a^{n+1} - (a + 1)^n \equiv a \pmod{4}$ , so $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ .
  Of the divisors of $7 \times 11 \times 13$, those congruent to $1 \mod 3$ are precisely those not divisible by $11$ (since $7$ and $13$ are both congruent to $1 \mod 3$). Thus $a$ divides $7 \times 13$. Now $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ is only possible if $a$ divides $13$.
