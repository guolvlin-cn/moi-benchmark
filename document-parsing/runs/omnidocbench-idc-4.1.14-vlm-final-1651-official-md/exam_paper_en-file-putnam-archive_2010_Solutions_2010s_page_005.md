B-5 First solution. The answer is no. Suppose otherwise. For the condition to make sense, $f$ must be differentiable. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, we must have $f'(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$. Also, the function $f'(x)$ is strictly increasing: if $y > x$ then $f'(y) = f(f(y)) > f(f(x)) = f'(x)$. In particular, $f'(y) > 0$ for all $y \in \mathbb{R}$.
  For any $x_0 \geq -1$, if $f(x_0) = b$ and $f'(x_0) = a > 0$, then $f'(x) > a$ for $x > x_0$ and thus $f(x) \geq a(x - x_0) + b$ for $x \geq x_0$. Then either $b < x_0$ or $a = f'(x_0) = f(f(x_0)) = f(b) \geq a(b - x_0) + b$. In the latter case, $b \leq a(x_0 + 1)/(a + 1) \leq x_0 + 1$. We conclude in either case that $f(x_0) \leq x_0 + 1$ for all $x_0 \geq -1$.
  It must then be the case that $f(f(x)) = f'(x) \leq 1$ for all $x$, since otherwise $f(x) > x + 1$ for large $x$. Now by the above reasoning, if $f(0) = b_0$ and $f'(0) = a_0 > 0$, then $f(x) > a_0x + b_0$ for $x > 0$. Thus for $x > \max\{0, -b_0 / a_0\}$, we have $f(x) > 0$ and $f(f(x)) > a_0x + b_0$. But then $f(f(x)) > 1$ for sufficiently large $x$, a contradiction.
  Second solution. (Communicated by Catalin Zara.) Suppose such a function exists. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and differentiable, so is $f \circ f = f'$. In particular, $f$ is twice differentiable; also, $f''(x) = f'(f(x))f'(x)$ is the product of two strictly increasing nonnegative functions, so it is also strictly increasing and nonnegative. In particular, we can choose $\alpha > 0$ and $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f''(x) > 4\alpha$ for all $x \geq M$. Then for all $x \geq M,$
    $$f (x) \geq f (M) + f ^ {\prime} (M) (x - M) + 2 \alpha (x - M) ^ {2}.$$
  In particular, for some $M' > M$, we have $f(x) \geq \alpha x^2$ for all $x \geq M'$.
  Pick $T > 0$ so that $\alpha T^2 > M'$. Then for $x \geq T$, $f(x) > M'$ and so $f'(x) = f(f(x)) \geq \alpha f(x)^2$. Now
      $$\frac{1}{f (T)} - \frac{1}{f (2 T)} = \int_ {T} ^ {2 T} \frac{f ^ {\prime} (t)}{f (t) ^ {2}} d t \geq \int_ {T} ^ {2 T} \alpha d t;$$
  however, as $T \to \infty$ , the left side of this inequality tends to 0 while the right side tends to $+\infty$ , a contradiction.

  Third solution. (Communicated by Noam Elkies.) Since $f$ is strictly increasing, for some $y_0$, we can define the inverse function $g(y)$ of $f$ for $y \geq y_0$. Then
  $x = g(f(x))$, and we may differentiate to find that $1 = g^{\prime}(f(x))f^{\prime}(x) = g^{\prime}(f(x))f(f(x))$. It follows that $g^{\prime}(y) = 1 / f(y)$ for $y \geq y_0$; since $g$ takes arbitrarily large values, the integral $\int_{y_0}^{\infty}dy / f(y)$ must diverge. One then gets a contradiction from any reasonable lower bound on $f(y)$ for $y$ large, e.g., the bound $f(x) \geq \alpha x^2$ from the second solution. (One can also start with a linear lower bound $f(x) \geq \beta x$, then use the integral expression for $g$ to deduce that $g(x) \leq \gamma \log x$, which in turn forces $f(x)$ to grow exponentially.)

# B-6 For any polynomial $p(x)$ , let $[p(x)]A$ denote the $n \times n$ matrix obtained by replacing each entry $A_{ij}$ of $A$ by $p(A_{ij})$ ; thus $A^{[k]} = [x^k ]A$ . Let $P(x) = x^{n} + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \dots +a_{0}$ denote the characteristic polynomial of $A$ . By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem,

        $$\begin{array}{l} 0 = A \cdot P (A) \\ = A ^ {n + 1} + a _ {n - 1} A ^ {n} + \dots + a _ {0} A \\ = A ^ {[ n + 1 ]} + a _ {n - 1} A ^ {[ n ]} + \dots + a _ {0} A ^ {[ 1 ]} \\ = [ x p (x) ] A. \\ \end{array}$$
  Thus each entry of A is a root of the polynomial xp(x) .

  Now suppose $m \geq n + 1$. Then
    $$\begin{array}{l} 0 = \left[ x ^ {m + 1 - n} P (x) \right] A \\ = A ^ {[ m + 1 ]} + a _ {n - 1} A ^ {[ m ]} + \dots + a _ {0} A ^ {[ m + 1 - n ]} \\ \end{array}$$
  since each entry of $A$ is a root of $x^{m+1-n}P(x)$. On the other hand,
      $$\begin{array}{l} 0 = A ^ {m + 1 - n} \cdot P (A) \\ = A ^ {m + 1} + a _ {n - 1} A ^ {m} + \dots + a _ {0} A ^ {m + 1 - n}. \\ \end{array}$$
  Therefore if $A^k = A^{[k]}$ for $m + 1 - n \leq k \leq m$, then $A^{m + 1} = A^{[m + 1]}$. The desired result follows by induction on $m$.
  Remark. David Feldman points out that the result is best possible in the following sense: there exist examples of $n \times n$ matrices $A$ for which $A^k = A^{[k]}$ for $k = 1, \ldots, n$ but $A^{n+1} \neq A^{[n+1]}$.
